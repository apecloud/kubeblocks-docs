<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>ChaosMesh is a chaos engineering experimentation platform targeting Kubernetes environments, aimed at helping users test system stability and fault tolerance by simulating various failure scenarios.</p>
<p>Chaos engineering is an advanced system testing methodology that intentionally injects various faults into distributed systems, such as network errors, disk failures, CPU load, etc., to verify the system's behavior and recovery capabilities when encountering failures. This proactive testing approach helps improve system reliability and resilience.</p>
<p>ChaosMesh provides a set of fault injection toolkits based on Kubernetes, including various failure scenarios such as network, kernel, disk, and container, capable of simulating various abnormal situations that may occur in real environments. Users can define the types of faults to be injected, scope, duration, and other parameters through YAML configuration files or a Web UI, and then ChaosMesh will execute the corresponding fault operations on the target Pods or nodes.</p>
<p>During the chaos experiment, ChaosMesh continuously monitors the system status and records various metrics and log information during the system recovery process. After the experiment is completed, the collected data can be analyzed to evaluate the system's resilience and fault tolerance capabilities, thereby optimizing system design and fixing potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ChaosMesh supports extending new fault scenarios to meet customized requirements in different scenarios.</p>
<p>The emergence of ChaosMesh has lowered the barrier to chaos experiments and can help development and operation teams more efficiently and systematically test and improve the reliability of distributed systems. Through the various chaos experiment scenarios provided by ChaosMesh, it becomes easier to identify the weaknesses in the system and enhance application reliability.</p>
<p>In summary, as an open-source chaos engineering platform, ChaosMesh brings better system reliability assurance for Kubernetes applications. In the increasingly complex cloud-native environment, continuously conducting chaos experiments is crucial for ensuring system high availability.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Pod Failure Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>The Pod Failure experiment in ChaosMesh simulates a scenario where Pods in a Kubernetes cluster experience failures. This chaos engineering test is crucial for validating the high availability and fault tolerance of distributed systems.</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit that encapsulates application containers. When a Pod fails, Kubernetes automatically detects the failure and takes corrective actions, such as recreating the Pod on another node or restarting it if possible. The Pod Failure experiment simulates the unavailability of Pods to evaluate how the system handles unexpected disruptions and recovers from them.</p>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh uses the PodChaos feature to simulate Pod failures. Users can configure the Pod Failure experiment in a YAML file by setting the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>mode: Specifies the experiment object selection mode (one/all/fixed/fixed-percent, etc.)</li>
<li>selector: Specifies the label selector for the target Pods</li>
</ul>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<h4>- Verifying High Availability</h4>
<p>Simulating Pod failures helps verify whether the system can automatically detect and recover from Pod failures, ensuring service availability even under adverse conditions.</p>
<h4>- Testing Failover Mechanisms</h4>
<p>This experiment tests the system's ability to handle Pod failures, including rescheduling Pods on other nodes and ensuring data consistency during recovery.</p>
<h4>- Identifying Potential Issues</h4>
<p>Real-world Pod failures may expose hidden issues such as configuration errors, resource contention, or bugs in application code. Simulating these failures helps identify and resolve these problems in advance.</p>
<h4>- Enhancing System Robustness</h4>
<p>By exposing the system to controlled Pod failure scenarios, developers and operations teams can gain deeper insights into system behavior and improve its robustness and resilience.</p>
<p>In summary, using ChaosMesh to simulate Pod failures is an effective method to ensure the reliability and fault tolerance of Kubernetes-based applications. It enables teams to identify weaknesses in the system before they become problematic in production environments and take corrective actions.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Delete Pod Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>Simulating a database instance failover scenario by deleting a Pod involves the following principles and significance:</p>
<h3>Principles:</h3>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, stateful database components are typically deployed as StatefulSets, with each Pod corresponding to a database instance.</p>
<p>When a running database Pod is deleted, Kubernetes automatically recreates a new Pod using the same persistent data volume.</p>
<p>The newly created Pod needs to perform database recovery operations based on the existing data and rejoin the database cluster. This process simulates a database instance failover.</p>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<h4>-Verifying the high availability of the database cluster</h4>
<p>By triggering a failover by deleting a Pod, you can check whether the database cluster can automatically recover when an instance fails, and whether the new instance can properly rejoin the cluster and provide services.</p>
<h4>-Testing the performance of database failover</h4>
<p>During the failover process, you can observe various metrics of the database cluster, such as failure detection time, new instance rebuilding time, data recovery time, etc., and evaluate whether the failover performance meets the requirements.</p>
<h4>-Discovering potential issues with database failover</h4>
<p>Real-world failover scenarios may expose some failures and edge cases, such as data inconsistency, split-brain, etc. Simulation helps to discover and fix these potential issues.</p>
<h4>-Enhancing the robustness of applications</h4>
<p>Applications need to have the ability to gracefully handle database failovers. Various failover exceptions discovered during experiments can be used to improve the design and implementation of applications.</p>
<p>In summary, simulating database failover by leveraging Kubernetes Pods is an efficient and controlled chaos engineering practice that helps to improve the reliability and resilience of distributed systems.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Kill process 1 Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>When testing the database failover scenario, we observe whether the database instance in KubeBlocks can switch over normally by killing the number 1 process in the main container of the Pod. The principle and significance are as follows:</p>
<h3>Principle:</h3>
<p>In the Linux system, each running process has a unique process ID (PID), and the number 1 process is the initialization process of the entire system.</p>
<p>The database process is usually not the number 1 process, but rather a child process forked from the number 1 process.</p>
<p>When the number 1 process is killed, all its child processes, including the database process, will also be terminated.</p>
<p>As a container orchestration system, KubeBlocks will detect the exit of the main process in the Pod, triggering the Pod rebuild process.</p>
<p>During the rebuild process, KubeBlocks will start a new database instance Pod and perform data recovery based on the existing data, thereby completing the failover.</p>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<h4>-Simulating actual process crash scenarios</h4>
<p>In production environments, processes may crash due to code errors, resource depletion, etc. Killing the number 1 process can simulate this extreme situation.</p>
<h4>-Testing edge cases for instance failover</h4>
<p>Directly deleting a Pod to trigger failover is a common case, while killing the number 1 process is an edge abnormal case, which can more comprehensively test the robustness of the failover mechanism.</p>
<h4>-Verifying the automatic recovery capability of the container orchestration system</h4>
<p>When the main process exits abnormally, KubeBlocks needs to be able to quickly detect and rebuild the Pod, ensuring service continuity. This is a test of its automatic recovery capability.</p>
<h4>-Discovering potential system vulnerabilities and defects</h4>
<p>Extreme exceptional situations may expose potential system vulnerabilities and defects, such as resource leaks, deadlocks, etc., which can help discover and fix problems in advance.</p>
<p>In summary, killing the number 1 process is an extreme approach to inducing database failover, which can subject KubeBlocks' database high availability and reliability to more stringent verification, thereby enhancing the robustness of the system.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">OOM Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>Testing the Failover operation of database instance Pods under OOM (Out of Memory) situations in Kubernetes is crucial, as it can verify the high availability and fault tolerance capabilities of the database cluster.</p>
<p>OOM refers to the situation where the system memory is insufficient, causing processes within the Pod to be unable to allocate the required memory resources. In such cases, Kubernetes will select one or more processes based on their OOM Score values within the Pod and perform memory eviction to release memory and ensure the stability of the entire system. You can deterministically trigger OOM for a specific process by setting its OOM Score to -1000, thereby simulating a memory shortage scenario.</p>
<p>In the Failover test, you will select a specific Replica Pod of the database instance as the OOM object. Since a database instance typically consists of a Primary node and multiple Secondary nodes, where the Primary node is responsible for write operations and the Secondary nodes are responsible for backup and read operations. Therefore, when the Primary Pod encounters OOM, it is necessary to verify whether the entire cluster can correctly execute the Failover operation, promote one of the Secondary Pods to become the new Primary, and adjust the roles and perform data replication for the other Pods to ensure the availability and data consistency of the cluster.</p>
<p>During the testing process, the test program will trigger OOM and closely monitor the entire Failover process. Once the Failover is detected as completed, it will verify the role labels of each Pod to confirm whether the new Primary node and Secondary nodes have been properly switched. Additionally, it will check whether the new Primary node can provide write services normally, and whether the Secondary nodes can correctly replicate data and provide read services.</p>
<p>Through this approach, the test system can comprehensively test the fault tolerance capability of the database instance under extreme memory pressure, ensuring that even in the event of node failure, the entire cluster can quickly recover and continue to provide services. This is crucial for ensuring the high availability and data consistency of the database, especially when running critical business in production environments.</p>
<p>In summary, the role of the OOM mechanism in Failover testing is to simulate extreme resource pressure situations, verify whether the database instance can correctly execute high availability policies in the event of failure, and evaluate the fault tolerance capabilities and reliability of the entire cluster through the verification of Failover results.</p></span>

<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">TimeOffset Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>ChaosMesh's Time Chaos feature aims to simulate time offset scenarios. Its working principle and implementation method are as follows:</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh modifies the target process's perception of time, causing it to mistakenly believe that the system time has shifted, thereby simulating a time error scenario. Such time errors may cause abnormal process behavior, such as timer triggering errors, inaccurate scheduled task execution times, etc.</p>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh utilizes the time-related system calls (clock_gettime, clock_settime, etc.) provided by the Linux system to control time. When initiating a Time Chaos attack, ChaosMesh attaches to the target process, intercepts its requests for time-related system calls, and returns artificially modified time values, thereby deceiving the process.</p>
<p>Specifically, ChaosMesh attaches to the target process using the ptrace system call, modifies the system call parameters and return values in its memory, and injects the desired time offset. Users can specify the following in the attack command:</p>
<ul>
<li>timeOffset: The time offset to be injected, e.g., +30m indicates a 30-minute shift forward</li>
<li>clockIds: The clock type to be affected, e.g., CLOCK_REALTIME affects the real-time clock</li>
<li>pid: The ID of the target process to be attacked
By setting these parameters, ChaosMesh can simulate various time error scenarios, such as time advancing, time lagging, and specific clock type errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the attack process, ChaosMesh continuously modifies the target process's perception of time. After the attack ends, ChaosMesh automatically removes the previously injected time modifications and restores the normal time.</p>
<p>Through the Time Chaos experiment, users can evaluate the robustness of distributed systems under clock error conditions, identify potential time-related bugs, optimize time handling strategies, and improve system reliability.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Evicting Pod Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>Evicting a Pod is an operation that forcibly removes a Pod from its current node, which can be used to simulate scenarios where nodes become unavailable or need maintenance. This operation helps verify the system's high availability and fault tolerance capabilities.</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, Pods are scheduled on nodes based on resource availability and scheduling policies. When a node becomes unhealthy or requires maintenance, it may be necessary to evict all Pods running on that node. Evicting a Pod triggers the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The eviction command sends a signal to the kubelet on the node to terminate the Pod gracefully.</li>
<li>The kubelet then starts terminating the Pod by sending termination signals to the containers within the Pod.</li>
<li>Once the Pod is terminated, Kubernetes reschedules the Pod on another healthy node in the cluster.</li>
<li>The new node initializes the Pod using the same persistent data volume (if applicable) and performs any necessary recovery operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>To evict Pods from a node, you can use the kubectl drain command, which safely evicts all Pods from the specified node, ensuring minimal disruption to services.</p>
<p>The kubectl drain command performs the following steps:
1. Mark the Node as Unschedulable: Prevents new Pods from being scheduled on the node.
2. Evict All Pods: Gracefully terminates all Pods on the node except DaemonSets (unless --ignore-daemonsets is specified).
3. Reschedule Pods: Kubernetes automatically reschedules the evicted Pods on other healthy nodes in the cluster.</p>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<h4>-Verifying High Availability</h4>
<p>By evicting Pods using kubectl drain, you can check whether the system can automatically recover when a node becomes unavailable, ensuring that services remain available and resilient.</p>
<h4>-Testing Failover Mechanisms</h4>
<p>Eviction simulates real-world scenarios where nodes may fail or require maintenance, allowing you to test the failover mechanisms and ensure that the system can handle such situations without significant downtime.</p>
<h4>-Discovering Potential Issues</h4>
<p>Real-world eviction scenarios may expose issues such as slow Pod termination, resource allocation problems, or service disruptions. Simulating these scenarios helps identify and address potential issues.</p>
<h4>-Enhancing System Robustness</h4>
<p>Regularly testing eviction scenarios improves the overall robustness of the system by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, ensuring that the system can handle unexpected node failures or maintenance activities.</p>
<p>In summary, evicting Pods using kubectl drain is a critical chaos engineering practice that helps improve the reliability and resilience of distributed systems by simulating node unavailability and verifying failover mechanisms. This method ensures that the eviction process is handled gracefully, minimizing service disruptions and enhancing system stability.</p></span>
<div class="page-break"></div><h1 style="page-break-before: always;">Connection Stress Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-size:24px; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 2px;">
<hr />
<p>Connection Stress fault experiment aims to simulate scenarios where the system encounters a high volume of connection requests, thereby testing the system's ability to handle connection stress. This is achieved by generating a large number of concurrent connections directly to the target service or Pod.</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>The experiment involves creating a large number of client connections to the target service, exhausting available connection resources and triggering the system's capacity planning or auto-scaling mechanisms. This approach mimics real-world traffic spikes and evaluates how the system handles high connection loads.</p>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>To generate a large number of connections, a custom script or tool is used that runs on a separate machine or within a dedicated container. This tool continuously establishes connections to the target service, simulating high connection stress.</p>
<p>Users can set the following parameters for the Connection Stress experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>connections: Specifies the total number of connections to establish.</li>
<li>concurrent: Specifies the number of concurrent connections to maintain.</li>
<li>duration: Specifies the duration of the connection stress test.</li>
<li>target_service: Specifies the endpoint or service to which connections are made.</li>
<li>interval: Specifies the interval between connection attempts (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<p>During the experiment, the system continuously monitors the connection status and resource usage of the target Pods. After the experiment ends, the connection generation tool stops, and the system returns to normal operation.</p>
<p>Through the Connection Stress fault experiment, users can evaluate the system's response to high connection load scenarios, such as scaling or connection handling limits, thereby optimizing resource scheduling and improving system robustness.</p>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<h4>-Testing Connection Handling Limits</h4>
<p>By injecting a large number of connections, you can verify whether the system can handle the maximum number of connections it is designed for and identify any bottlenecks or limitations.</p>
<h4>-Evaluating Auto-scaling Mechanisms</h4>
<p>Under high connection stress, the system may trigger auto-scaling policies to add more resources. This experiment helps evaluate the effectiveness and responsiveness of these mechanisms.</p>
<h4>-Identifying Potential Issues</h4>
<p>High connection loads can expose issues such as connection leaks, timeouts, or degraded performance. Identifying these issues early can help improve system stability and reliability.</p>
<h4>-Optimizing Resource Allocation</h4>
<p>Understanding how the system behaves under connection stress allows for better resource allocation and capacity planning, ensuring optimal performance even under heavy loads.</p>
<p>In summary, the Connection Stress experiment is an essential tool for evaluating the system's ability to handle high connection loads, ensuring that it can maintain performance and availability even under extreme conditions. By directly generating a large number of connections, this method provides a realistic simulation of high-traffic scenarios, helping to identify and address potential issues in advance.</p></span>

<p>The DNS Error experiment in ChaosMesh is designed to simulate DNS resolution failure scenarios. Below are the working principles and implementation methods:</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh configures network rules on the nodes where target Pods reside, artificially introducing DNS resolution failures. This simulates situations where Pods encounter DNS resolution errors when communicating with external resources.</p>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh leverages Linux kernel modules like Netfilter (such as iptables or nftables) to inject DNS resolution failure rules on the node hosting the target Pod. Specifically, it runs commands on the node to intercept and tamper with DNS queries, causing them to return erroneous responses or no response at all.</p>
<p>Users can define a DNS Error experiment by setting the following key parameters in the configuration file:</p>
<ul>
<li>action: Specifies the action to perform (error indicates injecting an error)</li>
<li>patterns: Selects a domain template that matches faults.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the experiment, ChaosMesh continuously monitors the network state. After the experiment ends, ChaosMesh automatically cleans up the injected network rules and restores the normal network environment.</p>
<p>By conducting a DNS Error experiment, users can evaluate the stability and availability of distributed systems under DNS resolution failure conditions, thereby optimizing DNS configurations and enhancing system robustness.</p></span>

<p>The DNS Random experiment in ChaosMesh is designed to simulate scenarios where DNS resolution results are randomized. Below are the working principles and implementation methods:</p>
<h3>Working Principle:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh configures network rules on the nodes where target Pods reside, artificially introducing randomization in DNS resolution results. This simulates situations where Pods encounter inconsistent DNS resolution results when communicating with external resources.</p>
<h3>Implementation Method:</h3>
<p>ChaosMesh leverages Linux kernel modules like Netfilter (such as iptables or nftables) to inject DNS resolution randomization rules on the node hosting the target Pod. Specifically, it runs commands on the node to intercept and tamper with DNS queries, causing them to return randomly generated IP addresses or other resolution results.</p>
<p>Users can define a DNS Random experiment by setting the following key parameters in the configuration file:</p>
<ul>
<li>action: Specifies the action to perform (random indicates randomizing resolution results)</li>
<li>patterns: Selects a domain template that matches faults.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the experiment, ChaosMesh continuously monitors the network state. After the experiment ends, ChaosMesh automatically cleans up the injected network rules and restores the normal network environment.</p>
