# Known Issues

## Issue 1: KubeBlocks creates enormous number of secrets

### Problem Description
KubeBlocks keeps creating an enormous number of secrets for each cluster and never stops. You may see the following information in **KubeBlocks** logs:

```bash
INFO reconcile object *v1.ServiceAccount with action UPDATE OK
```

### Affected Version
- KubeBlocks v1.0.0
- Kubernetes versions \â‰¤ 1.24

### Root Cause
Before Kubernetes version 1.24, Kubernetes automatically generated Secret-based tokens for ServiceAccounts, as documented in [Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/).

### Solution
Upgrade KubeBlocks to `v1.0.1-beta.3` or later.

## Issue 2: PostgreSQL fails to start with special characters in password

### Problem Description
PostgreSQL may fail to start when the password contains certain special characters. By checking POD logs:
```bash
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/scanner.py", line 116, in check_token
    self.fetch_more_tokens()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/scanner.py", line 231, in fetch_more_tokens
    return self.fetch_anchor()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/scanner.py", line 621, in fetch_anchor
    self.tokens.append(self.scan_anchor(AnchorToken))
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/scanner.py", line 929, in scan_anchor
    raise ScannerError("while scanning an %s" % name, start_mark,
yaml.scanner.ScannerError: while scanning an anchor
  in "<unicode string>", line 45, column 17:
          password: &amp;JgE#F5x&amp;eNwis*2dW!7&amp ...
                    ^
```

### Affected Version
- All KubeBlocks versions with PostgreSQL clusters

### Solution
Use passwords that do not contain special characters that may cause parsing issues in PostgreSQL configuration files.

## How to report a bug

To report a bug, you may

1. create an issue in the [KubeBlocks GitHub repository](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/issues/).
2. [optional] provide the zip file generated by `kbcli report` command:
```bash
kbcli report cluster <clusterName>  --with-logs --mask # pack cluster manifest, version, and logs
kbcli report kubeblocks --with-logs --mask # pack kubeblocks logs
```
where `clusterName` is the name of the cluster you are reporting the bug for, and `--mask` will mask sensitive info for secrets and configmap.
