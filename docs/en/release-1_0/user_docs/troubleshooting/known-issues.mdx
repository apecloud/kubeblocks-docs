### Kubeblocks 1.0.0 creates enoromous number of secrets

If you are running KubeBlocks on K8s \<\= 1.24, KubeBlocks keeps creating enoromous number of secrets for each cluster and never end.

And you can see the following information in KubeBlocks logs:

```bash
INFO reconcile object *v1.ServiceAccount with action UPDATE OK
```

This is because before version 1.24, Kubernetes automatically generated Secret-based tokens for ServiceAccounts, as documented in [Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/).

To fix this, upgrade KubeBlocks to` v1.0.0-beta.3` or later.
