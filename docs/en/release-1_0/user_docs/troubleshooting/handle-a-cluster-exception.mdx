### List of K8s Resources created by KubeBlocks when creating a Cluster

To get the full list of associated resources created by KubeBlocks for given cluster:

```bash
kubectl get cmp,its,po -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<CLUSTER_NAME> -n demo # cluster and worload
kubectl get backuppolicy,backupschedule,backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<CLUSTER_NAME> -n demo # data protection resources
kubectl get componentparameter,parameter -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<CLUSTER_NAME> -n demo # configuration resources
kubectl get opsrequest -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<CLUSTER_NAME> -n demo # opsrequest resources
kubectl get svc,secret,cm,pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<CLUSTER_NAME> -n demo # k8s native resources
```

For troubleshooting,

1. describe resource such as Cluster, Component, e.g.
```bash
kubectl describe TYPE NAME
```

2. check database instance logs
```bash
kubectl logs <podName> -c <containerName>
```

3. check KubeBlocks logs
```bash
kubectl -n kb-system logs deployments/kubeblocks -f
```

### How to get the detail of each backup method

Details of each backup method are defined in `ActionSet` in KubeBlocks.

For example, To get the `ActionSet` which defines the behavior of backup method named `wal-g-archive` in PostgreSQL, for instance:

```bash
kubectl -n demo get bp pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy -oyaml | yq '.spec.backupMethods[] | select(.name=="wal-g-archive") | .actionSetName'
```

ActionSet defined:

- backup type
- both backup and restore procedures
- environment variables used in procedures

And you may check details of each ActionSet to find out how backup and restore will be performed.


### How to Check Compatible versions

Versions and it compatibility rules are embedded in `ComponentVersion` CR in KubeBlocks.
To the the list of compatible versions:

```bash
kubectl get cmpv postgresql -ojson | jq '.spec.compatibilityRules'
```

<details open>

<summary>Example Output</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "compDefs": [
      "postgresql-12-"
    ],
    "releases": [
      "12.14.0",
      "12.14.1",
      "12.15.0"
    ]
  },
  {
    "compDefs": [
      "postgresql-14-"
    ],
    "releases": [
      "14.7.2",
      "14.8.0"
    ]
  }
]
```

</details>

Releases are grouped by component definitions, and each group has a list of compatible releases.
In this example, it shows you can upgrade from version `12.14.0` to `12.14.1` or `12.15.0`, and upgrade from `14.7.2` to `14.8.0`.
But cannot upgrade from `12.14.0` to `14.8.0`.


### ComponentDefinition status is Unavailable

If you made some changes to the ComponentDefinition, the status of ComponentDefinition may turn to `Unavailable`.
KubeBlocks sets the ComponentDefinition as `Unavailable` to prevent the changes from affecting existing clusters.

By describing the ComponentDefinition, you can see following message:

```text
Status:
  Message:              immutable fields can't be updated
  Observed Generation:  3
  Phase:                Unavailable
```

If the changes made are on-purpose, you can annotate the ComponentDefinition by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl annotate componentdefinition \<COMPONENT_DEFINITION_NAME\> apps.kubeblocks.io/skip-immutable-check\=true
```


### Failed to Install KubeBlocks on K8s \<\= 1.23

If you are using K8s \<\= 1.23, you may encounter the following error when installing KubeBlocks:

```bash
unknown field "x-kubernetes-validations" .... if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate\=false
```

This is because the `x-kubernetes-validations` field is not supported in K8s \<\= 1.23.

You can fix this by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl create -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/v1.0.0/kubeblocks_crds.yaml --validate\=false
```

### How to cancel a running OpsRequest

KubeBlocks supports to `cancel`  OpsRequest meets the following conditions:

- The OpsRequest is in `Running` state
- The OpsRequest type is `VerticalScaling`, `HorizontalScaling`

To cancel a running OpsRequest, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl patch opsrequest <OPSREQUEST_NAME> -p '{"spec":{"cancel":true}}' --type=merge
```

### Cluster/Component stuck in `Updating` status

If you find that a cluster/component is stuck in `Updating` status:


1. check if all pods are in `Running` status
2. check pod logs to see if there are any errors
3. check if each Pod has expected `roles` if required, to check the `roles` of a Pod, you can run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get po <POD_NAME> -L kubeblocks.io/role
```
4. check for Pods, if the container status image matches the pod spec image
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:
spec:
  containers:
  - image: repo/image:tag  # <==== image in spec
    name: c1
status:
  containerStatuses:
    containerID: containerd://123456
    image: repo/image:tag # <====== image in status
    imageID: repo/image:tag@sha256:123456
    name: c1
```
If the two fields are not match, please check if there are two or more images share the same `IMAGG ID` but of different `IMAGE` tags.

If so, please remove those images on your node and create a new Cluster.


### Cluster stuck in `Deleting` status, and KubeBlocks logs: `has no pods to running the pre-terminate action`

When deleting a cluster, one may find the cluster stuck in `Deleting` status, and the following error in KubeBlocks logs:

```bash
kubectl -n kb-system logs deployments/kubeblocks -f
```
And you may see the following error in KubeBlocks logs:

```bash
> INFO	build error: has no pods to running the pre-terminate action
```

This is because KubeBlocks will run the `pre-terminate` lifecycle action if defined in corresponding `ComponentDefinition`.
If there are no pods to run the pre-terminate action, the cluster will stuck in `Deleting` status until the pre-terminate action is completed.
To skip the pre-terminate action, you can annotate the Component by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl annotate component <COMPONENT_NAME> apps.kubeblocks.io/skip-pre-terminate-action=true
```

This case happens when you create a cluster but for some reason, it failed to create any pod (e.g. failed to pull the image or network issue or not enough resources).
