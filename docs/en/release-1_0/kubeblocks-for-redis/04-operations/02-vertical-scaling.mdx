# Vertical Scaling for Redis Replication Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a Redis Replication Cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU/memory) for Redis instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks orchestrates scaling with minimal impact:
1. Secondary replicas update first
2. Primary updates last after secondaries are healthy
3. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Redis Replication Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Secondary replicas are updated first (one at a time)
1. Primary is updated last after secondary replicas are healthy
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the redis component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: redis-replication-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: redis-replication
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: redis
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```
  What Happens During Vertical Scaling?
  - Secondary Pods are recreated first to ensure the primary Pod remains available.
  - Once all secondary Pods are updated, the primary Pod is restarted with the new resource configuration.


  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops redis-replication-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                           TYPE              CLUSTER             STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  redis-replication-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   redis-replication   Running   0/2        11s
  redis-replication-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   redis-replication   Running   1/2        36s
  redis-replication-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   redis-replication   Running   2/2        52s
  redis-replication-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   redis-replication   Running   2/2        52s
  redis-replication-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   redis-replication   Succeed   2/2        52s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: redis
        serviceVersion: "7.2.4"
        disableExporter: false
        replicas: 2
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          limits:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
    ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU:Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting Redis parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
kbcli cluster describe redis-replication -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT        INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
redis                                1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      <none>
redis-sentinel                       500m / 500m          512Mi / 512Mi           data:20Gi      <none>
```

Only resources for Redis component has been updated, but those for redis-sentinel remains the same.

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Redis Replication Cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster redis-replication -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a Redis Replication Cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the redis component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your Redis Replication Cluster remains performant and resilient.
