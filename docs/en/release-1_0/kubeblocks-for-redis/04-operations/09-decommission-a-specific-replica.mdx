# Decommission a Specific Pod in KubeBlocks-Managed Redis Clusters

This guide explains how to decommission (take offline) specific Pods in Redis clusters managed by KubeBlocks. Decommissioning provides precise control over cluster resources while maintaining availability. Use this for workload rebalancing, node maintenance, or addressing failures.

## Why Decommission Pods with KubeBlocks?

In traditional StatefulSet-based deployments, Kubernetes lacks the ability to decommission specific Pods. StatefulSets ensure the order and identity of Pods, and scaling down always removes the Pod with the highest ordinal number (e.g., scaling down from 3 replicas removes Pod `-2` first). This limitation prevents precise control over which Pod to take offline, which can complicate maintenance, workload distribution, or failure handling.

KubeBlocks overcomes this limitation by enabling administrators to decommission specific Pods directly. This fine-grained control ensures high availability and allows better resource management without disrupting the entire cluster.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Redis Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Decommission a Pod

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Replica specified in `onlineInstancesToOffline` is removed
2. Pod terminates gracefully
3. Cluster transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

To decommission a specific Pod (e.g., 'redis-replication-redis-1'), you can use one of the following methods:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="opsRequest" label="OpsRequest API" default>

  Option 1: Using OpsRequest

  Create an OpsRequest to mark the Pod as offline:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: redis-replication-decommission-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: redis-replication
    type: HorizontalScaling
    horizontalScaling:
    - componentName: redis
      scaleIn:
        onlineInstancesToOffline:
          - 'redis-replication-redis-1'  # Specifies the instance names that need to be taken offline
  ```

  #### Monitor the Decommissioning Process
  Check the progress of the decommissioning operation:

  ```bash
  kubectl get ops redis-replication-decommission-ops -n demo -w
  ```
  Expected Output:

  ```bash
  NAME                                 TYPE                CLUSTER             STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  redis-replication-decommission-ops   HorizontalScaling   redis-replication   Succeed   1/1        71s
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ClusterAPI" label="Cluster API">

  Option 1: Using Cluster API

  Alternatively, update the Cluster resource directly to decommission the Pod:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: redis
        replicas: 1       # explected replicas after decommission
        offlineInstances:
          - redis-replication-redis-1   # <----- Specify Pod to be decommissioned
   ...
  ```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Verify the Decommissioning

After applying the updated configuration, verify the remaining Pods in the cluster:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-replication-redis-0 3/3     Running   0          33m33s
```

## Summary
Key takeaways:
- Traditional StatefulSets lack precise Pod removal control
- KubeBlocks enables targeted Pod decommissioning
- Two implementation methods: OpsRequest or Cluster API
This provides granular cluster management while maintaining availability.
