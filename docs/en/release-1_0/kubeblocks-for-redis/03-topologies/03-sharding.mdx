# Deploying a Redis Sharding Cluste (Cluster Mode) with KubeBlocks

Redis Cluster distributes data across multiple nodes (shards) using hash-based partitioning, allowing horizontal scaling for both reads and writes.

**Use Cases**
- Large-scale applications requiring high throughput.
- Distributed caching and session storage.
- Write-heavy workloads (e.g., real-time analytics).

## Deploying the Redis Sharding Cluster

To create a redis sharding cluster (cluster mode)  with 3 shards, and 2 replica for each shard:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: redis-sharding
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  shardings:
  - name: shard
    shards: 3
    template:
      name: redis
      componentDef: redis-cluster-7
      disableExporter: true
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '1'
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '1'
          memory: 1Gi
      serviceVersion: 7.2.4
      volumeClaimTemplates:
      - name: data
        spec:
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 20Gi
      services:
      - name: redis-advertised # This is a per-pod svc, and will be used to parse advertised endpoints
        podService: true
        #  - NodePort
        #  - LoadBalancer
        serviceType: NodePort
```

**Key Configuration Details**:
- `shardings`: Specifies a list of ShardingSpec objects that configure the sharding topology for components of a Cluster.

## Verifying the Deployment

### Check the Cluster Status
Once the cluster is deployed, check its status:
```bash
kubectl get cluster redis-sharding  -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
redis-sharding                        Delete               Running   103s
```

### Verify Component and Pod Status

Get all componets working for this cluster:
```bash
kubectl get cmp -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-sharding -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                       DEFINITION                      SERVICE-VERSION   STATUS    AGE
redis-sharding-shard-5cd   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
redis-sharding-shard-drg   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
redis-sharding-shard-tgf   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
```
Each component stands for a shard, with hash id as suffix.

Check pods and their roles

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-sharding -L  kubeblocks.io/role -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
redis-sharding-shard-5cd-0   2/2     Running   0          3m55s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-5cd-1   2/2     Running   0          3m35s   secondary
redis-sharding-shard-drg-0   2/2     Running   0          3m53s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-drg-1   2/2     Running   0          3m35s   secondary
redis-sharding-shard-tgf-0   2/2     Running   0          3m54s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-tgf-1   2/2     Running   0          3m36s   secondary
```
There are in-total six replicas in the cluster, two (one primarily and one secondary) for each component.


## Cleanup
To remove all resources created during this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster redis-sharding -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```
