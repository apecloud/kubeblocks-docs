# Deploying a Redis Standalone Cluster with KubeBlocks

A standalone Redis deployment consists of a single Redis server instance running independently without any replication or clustering. It is the simplest and most lightweight deployment model.

**Use Cases**
- Development & testing environments.
- Small applications with low traffic.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

## Deploying the Redis Standalone Cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: redis-standalone
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: redis    # set to reids
  topology: standalone # set topology to standalone
  componentSpecs:
  - name: redis
    replicas: 1       # set replica to 1
    serviceVersion: 7.2.4
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "0.5"
        memory: "0.5Gi"
      requests:
        cpu: "0.5"
        memory: "0.5Gi"
    volumeClaimTemplates:
      - name: data
        spec:
          accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 20Gi
```

**Key Configuration Details**:
- `clusterDef: redis`: Specifies the ClusterDefinition CR for the cluster.
- `topology: standalone`: Configures the cluster to use standalone topology.
- `componentSpecs`: Defines the components in the cluster:
  - Component 'redis':
    - `serviceVersion: 7.2.4`: Specifies the version of the Redis service to be deployed.


## Verifying the Deployment

### Check the Cluster Status
Once the cluster is deployed, check its status:
```bash
kubectl get cluster redis-standalone  -n demo -w
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME               CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
redis-standalone   redis                Delete               Running   34s
```

### Verify Component Status
```bash
kubectl get component redis-standalone-redis -n demo
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME                     DEFINITION              SERVICE-VERSION   STATUS    AGE
redis-standalone-redis   redis-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   90s
```

## Cleanup
To remove all resources created during this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster redis-standalone -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```
