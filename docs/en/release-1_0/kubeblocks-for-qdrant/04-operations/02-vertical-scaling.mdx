# Vertical Scaling for Qdrant Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a Qdrant Cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU/memory) for Qdrant instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks ensures minimal impact during scaling operations by following a controlled, role-aware update strategy:
**Role-Aware Replicas (Primary/Secondary Replicas)**
- Secondary replicas update first – Non-leader pods are upgraded to minimize disruption.
- Primary updates last – Only after all secondaries are healthy does the primary pod restart.
- Cluster state progresses from Updating → Running once all replicas are stable.

**Role-Unaware Replicas (Ordinal-Based Scaling)**
If replicas have no defined roles, updates follow Kubernetes pod ordinal order:
- Highest ordinal first (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0) to ensure deterministic rollouts.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Qdrant Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Pods are updated in pod ordinal order, from highest to lowest, (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0)
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the qdrant component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: qdrant-cluster
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: qdrant
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```

  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:

  ```bash
  NAME                       TYPE              CLUSTER         STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   0/3        32s
  qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   1/3        55s
  qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   2/3        82s
  qdrant-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   3/3        2m13s
  ```

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: qdrant
        replicas: 3
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          limits:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
    ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU:Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting Qdrant parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
kbcli cluster describe qdrant-cluster -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT   INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
qdrant                          1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      <none>
```

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Qdrant Cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a Qdrant Cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the qdrant component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your Qdrant Cluster remains performant and resilient.
