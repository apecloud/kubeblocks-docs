# Upgrading the Minor Version of a Qdrant Cluster in KubeBlocks

This guide walks you through the deployment and minor version upgrade of a Qdrant Cluster managed by KubeBlocks, ensuring minimal downtime during the process.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a Qdrant Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing Qdrant Clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a Qdrant Cluster with 3 replicas.

Apply the following YAML configuration to deploy the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: qdrant-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: qdrant
  topology: cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: qdrant
      serviceVersion: 1.10.0
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

## Verifying the Deployment
Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output::

```bash
NAME             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
qdrant-cluster   qdrant               Delete               Creating   49s
qdrant-cluster   qdrant               Delete               Running    62s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your Qdrant Cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.

## List All Available Qdrant Versions

Use the following command to display the Qdrant versions supported by your KubeBlocks installation:
```bash
kubectl get cmpv qdrant
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME     VERSIONS                                STATUS      AGE
qdrant   1.14.0,1.10.0,1.8.4,1.8.1,1.7.3,1.5.0   Available   26d
```

Note: The list of supported versions may vary depending on your KubeBlocks version.

## Upgrading the Qdrant Version

### Check compatible versions for the same ComponentDefinition

**Step 1.** Get the list of `ComponentDefinition` associated with a given `ComponentVersion`

```bash
kubectl get cmpv qdrant -ojson | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."componentversion.kubeblocks.io/compatible-definitions"' | tr ',' '\n'
```

<details>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>
```text
qdrant-1.0.0
```
</details>

**Step 2.** Get the list of ComponentDefinition associated with a given ComponentVersion

```bash
kubectl get cmpv qdrant -o json | jq -r '.spec.compatibilityRules[] | select(.compDefs | any(startswith("^qdrant"))) | .releases[]'
```

This returns versions compatible with `ComponentDefinition` named `qdrant`:

<details open>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>
```text
1.5.0
1.7.3
1.8.1
1.8.4
1.10.0
1.14.0
```
</details>

### Apply the Upgrade

To upgrade the Qdrant version, modify the serviceVersion field in the Cluster resource. In this example, we will upgrade the Qdrant version from `1.10.0` to `1.14.0`

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="opsRequest" label="OpsRequest API" default>

  Option 1: Using OpsRequest

  You can upgrade the cluster using an OpsRequest:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: qdrant-upgrade
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
    clusterName: qdrant-cluster
    type: Upgrade
    upgrade:
      components:
      - componentName: qdrant
        # Specifies the desired service version of component
        serviceVersion: "1.14.0"
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ClusterAPI" label="Cluster API">
  Option 1: Using the Declarative Cluster API

  Alternatively, you may stop the cluster by setting the `spec.componentSpecs.serviceVersion` field in the cluster configuration:

  ```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: qdrant-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: qdrant
  topology: cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: qdrant
      serviceVersion: 1.14.0  # set to 1.14.0 for upgrading
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verification


### Monitor the Upgrade Process

Check OpsRequest progress:
```bash
kubectl get ops -n demo qdrant-upgrade -w
```

Sample Output:
```
NAME             TYPE      CLUSTER          STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
qdrant-upgrade   Upgrade   qdrant-cluster   Succeed   3/3        8m13s
```

Check pods:
```
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=qdrant-cluster
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-0   2/2     Running   1 (7m23s ago)   13m
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-1   2/2     Running   1 (7m49s ago)   12m
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-2   2/2     Running   1 (7m59s ago)   12m
```

**Key Observations:**
- Pods are not recreated, `RESTARTS` counter increased by one.
- Pods are updated one by one in pod ordinal order, from highest to lowest


### Check Cluster Status
Ensure the cluster is in the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo -w
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY    STATUS    AGE
qdrant-cluster   qdrant               Delete               Running   17m
```

### Verify the Qdrant Version

Connect to the upgraded instances and verify the Qdrant version:
```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n demo qdrant-cluster-qdrant-0 -c kbagent -- \
   curl http://127.0.0.1:6333
```

Example Output:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:6333
{"title":"qdrant - vector search engine","version":"1.14.0","commit":"3617a0111fc8590c4adcc6e88882b63ca4dda9e7"}%
```

## Summary
