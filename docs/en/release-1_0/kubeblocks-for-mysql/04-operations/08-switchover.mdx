# Planned Switchover in a MySQL Cluster

A **switchover** is a planned operation where the primary instance in a MySQL cluster proactively transfers its role to a secondary instance. Unlike an unplanned failover, which occurs during unexpected failures, a switchover ensures a controlled and predictable role transition with minimal service disruption.

## **Benefits of Switchover**
1. **Minimal Downtime**: The primary instance actively transfers its role to the secondary instance, resulting in very short service downtime (typically a few hundred milliseconds)
2. **Controlled Transition**: Ensures a seamless and predictable role change compared to failover, which involves detecting and recovering from a failure, often causing longer delays (several seconds or more).
3. **Maintenance-Friendly**: Ideal for planned maintenance tasks, such as node upgrades or decommissioning, while ensuring uninterrupted service.

## **Switchover vs. Failover**

| **Aspect**                  | **Switchover**                            | **Failover**                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Initiation**              | Planned and manually triggered            | Unplanned and automatically triggered|
| **Downtime**                | Few hundred milliseconds                  | Several seconds or more               |
| **Primary Role Transition** | Proactively transferred                   | Reactively promoted                   |
| **Use Case**                | Planned maintenance (e.g., upgrades)      | Handling unexpected failures          |

Using a switchover ensures smooth transitions and minimal service disruption, making it the preferred choice for planned maintenance activities.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
  - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
  - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
  - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

Deploy a 2-node semi-sync MySQL cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary):

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the status of the MySQL cluster as it is created:
```bash
kubectl get cluster -n demo -w
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Creating   4s
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running    62s
```

## Check Roles
List the Pods and their roles (primary or secondary):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
```
Example Output:
```
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0	primary
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1	secondary
```


## Performing a Planned Switchover

To initiate a planned switchover, create an OpsRequest resource as shown below:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-switchover-ops
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: example-mysql-cluster
  type: Switchover
  switchover:
  - componentName: mysql
    instanceName: example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0
EOF
```
Key Parameters:
- `instanceName`: Specifies the instance (Pod) that is primary or leader before a switchover operation.

## Monitoring the Switchover

You can check the progress of the scaling operation with the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe ops example-mysql-switchover-ops -n demo
```

Expected Result:
```bash
Status:
  Phase:            Succeed
  Progress:         1/1
  ...
```
## Verify the Switchover

After the switchover is executed, the specified instance ('example-semisync-mysql-mysql-0') will be promoted to the primary role, while the previously primary instance ('example-semisync-mysql-mysql-1') will take on the secondary role.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0	secondary
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1	primary
```

In this example:
- Pod 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1' has been promoted to the primary role.
- Pod 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0' has transitioned to the secondary role.



## Summary
Key Benefits of Planned Switchover:
1. Minimal Downtime: The operation completes within a few hundred milliseconds, ensuring service continuity.
2. Controlled Transition: Switchover ensures a predictable and seamless role change, unlike failovers, which are reactive and take longer.
3. Ideal for Maintenance: Enables tasks like upgrades, node decommissioning, or rebalancing without impacting application availability.

In this guide, you learned how to:
- Deploy a MySQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
- Perform a planned switchover to transfer the primary role from one instance to another.
- Verify the success of the switchover operation and the updated roles of the Pods.

Planned switchover is a critical operation for maintaining high availability during maintenance tasks, ensuring minimal service disruption and predictable transitions in highly available systems.
