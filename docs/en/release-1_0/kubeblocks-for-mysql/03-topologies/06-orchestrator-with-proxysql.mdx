# Deploying a MySQL Cluster and Orchestrator and ProxySQL with KubeBlocks

Semi-synchronous replication enhances data consistency between primary and replica nodes by requiring acknowledgment from at least one replica before committing transactions.

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a MySQL cluster using **KubeBlocks** with **Orchestrator** for high availability and failover management, and **ProxySQL** for advanced query routing and load balancing. Together, these tools create a robust and efficient MySQL cluster infrastructure.

### **What is Orchestrator?**

Orchestrator is a powerful MySQL High Availability (HA) and failover management tool. It automates monitoring, fault detection, and topology management for MySQL clusters, making it ideal for managing large-scale deployments. Key features include:

- **Replication Topology Monitoring**: Provides a real-time view of the MySQL replication topology.
- **Automated Failover**: Promotes a healthy replica to primary in case of failure, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Topology Management**: Simplifies reconfiguration, rebalancing, and recovery of MySQL clusters.

### **What is ProxySQL?**

ProxySQL is a high-performance MySQL proxy that acts as a middleware between MySQL clients and database servers. It enhances cluster performance with features such as:

- **Query Routing**: Directs queries to the appropriate servers based on their purpose (e.g., read or write).
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across replicas to optimize resource usage.
- **Query Caching**: Reduces database load by caching frequent queries.
- **Failover Support**: Seamlessly handles failover scenarios without interrupting application services.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Install the Orchestrator Addon

1. View the Addon versions.
```bash
# including pre-release versions
helm search repo kubeblocks/orchestrator --devel --versions
```

2. Install the Addon. Specify a version with '--version'.
```bash
helm install kb-addon-orc kubeblocks/orchestrator --namespace kb-system --create-namespace --version x.y.z
```

3. Verify whether this Addon is installed.
```bash
helm list -A
```
Expected Output:
```bash
orchestrator           	kb-system  	1       	2025-02-14 11:12:32.286516 +0800 CST   deployed	orchestrator-1.0.0          	3.2.6
```
The STATUS is deployed and this Addon is installed successfully.

## Deploying the MySQL Cluster with Orchestrator

KubeBlocks provides a declarative approach to deploying MySQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MySQL cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary and 1 replica) in semi-synchronous mode. This configuration also integrates Orchestrator (3 nodes) for failover management and ProxySQL (2 nodes) for query routing and load balancing.

**Explanation of Key Fields:**
MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster Configuration
- `clusterDef`: Specifies the ClusterDefinition CR for the cluster. The ClusterDefinition 'mysql' contains multiple topologies, such as 'semisync', 'semisync-proxysql', 'mgr', 'mgr-proxysql', 'orc', 'orc-proxysql'.
- `topology : orc-proxysql`:  integrates Orchestrator for failover and ProxySQL for query routing.
- `serviceRefs`: Configures the MySQL cluster to connect to the Orchestrator cluster.
    - `name : orchestrator`: The name of the service reference for Orchestrator.
    - `namespace: demo`: Specifies that the Orchestrator cluster is in the same demo namespace.
    - `clusterServiceSelector`:
        - `cluster: example-orc-cluster`: Selects the Orchestrator cluster named example-orc-cluster.
        - `service`:
            - `component: orchestrator`: Uses the Orchestrator component from the example-orc-cluster cluster.
            - `service: orchestrator`: Specifies the service name.
            - `port: orc-http`: Refers to the HTTP port of the Orchestrator service.

Orchestrator Cluster Configuration
- `componentDef: orchestrator-raft`: Specifies that this component uses the Raft high-availability model.
- `replicas: 3`: Configures the Orchestrator cluster to run with 3 nodes for Raft-based high availability.

The first part of the YAML file configures a MySQL cluster ('example-mysql-cluster') with 1 primary and 1 replica in semi-synchronous mode, and integrates it with the Orchestrator cluster.

The second part of the YAML file defines an Orchestrator cluster ('example-orc-cluster') using Raft high-availability mode. This cluster manages the MySQL cluster, monitoring its topology and handling failover.

The serviceRefs in the MySQL cluster configuration establishes the connection between the MySQL semi-synchronous cluster and the Orchestrator cluster:
- It specifies the Orchestrator cluster ('example-orc-cluster') that will manage the MySQL cluster.
- Orchestrator will monitor the MySQL cluster's topology and handle failover when the primary node fails.
- The 'orc-http' port is used by Orchestrator to communicate with the MySQL cluster.


## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster -n demo
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   2m32s
example-orc-cluster     orchestrator         Delete               Running   2m31s
```

## Connecting to the MySQL Cluster
KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the MySQL root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
root

kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
GX596H32Oz
```

To connect to the cluster's primary node, use the MySQL client:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql-server.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -pGX596H32Oz
```

## Testing Semi-Synchronous Replication

In this section, we will test the semi-synchronous replication of the MySQL cluster by verifying the roles of the pods and checking their replication statuses.

First, list all the pods in the cluster, along with their roles, to identify the primary and secondary instances:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
```
Example Output:
```
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0	primary
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1	secondary
```

From the output, we can see the following:
- 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0' is the primary instance.
- 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1' is the secondary instance.
  The 'kubeblocks.io/role' label helps us easily distinguish between the roles of the instances in the replication setup.


Next, connect to the primary instance ('example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0') and check its semi-synchronous replication status. Use the following command to execute a query inside the MySQL pod:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -pGX596H32Oz -e "show status like 'Rpl%_status';"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
+------------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name                | Value |
+------------------------------+-------+
| Rpl_semi_sync_replica_status | OFF   |
| Rpl_semi_sync_source_status  | ON   |
+------------------------------+-------+
```
Explanation:
- "Rpl_semi_sync_source_status: ON": This indicates that the primary instance is configured for semi-synchronous replication as the source (or master).
- "Rpl_semi_sync_replica_status: OFF": This indicates that the primary instance is not acting as a replica in the replication setup.

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -pGX596H32Oz -e "show status like 'Rpl%_status';"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
+------------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name                | Value |
+------------------------------+-------+
| Rpl_semi_sync_replica_status | ON   |
| Rpl_semi_sync_source_status  | OFF   |
+------------------------------+-------+
```
Explanation:
- "Rpl_semi_sync_replica_status: ON": This indicates that the secondary instance is acting as a semi-synchronous replica and is actively receiving and acknowledging changes from the primary instance.
- "Rpl_semi_sync_source_status: OFF": This indicates that the secondary instance is not acting as a source (or master) in the replication setup.

## Failover Testing

The following steps demonstrate how to trigger a failover in a MySQL cluster and verify the role changes of the pods.

To initiate a failover, delete the Pod currently assigned the primary role:

```bash
kubectl delete pod example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -n demo
pod "example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0" deleted
```

This will trigger a failover, and the secondary instance will be promoted to the primary role.
After a while, the killed pod will be recreated and will take the secondary role:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
```
Expected Output:
```bash
example-semisync-mysql-mysql-0	secondary
example-semisync-mysql-mysql-1	primary
```

This process demonstrates how the failover mechanism ensures high availability by automatically promoting a secondary instance to the primary role in the event of a failure.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the MySQL cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete cluster example-orc-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary

This guide demonstrated how to deploy a MySQL cluster with semi-synchronous replication, Orchestrator integration for high availability, and ProxySQL for query routing and load balancing using KubeBlocks. By leveraging the declarative configuration approach, you can easily scale and manage MySQL clusters in Kubernetes environments.
