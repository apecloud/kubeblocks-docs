Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster kafka-separated-cluster -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:

```bash
kubectl get cluster kafka-separated-cluster -n demo
NAME                      CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
kafka-separated-cluster   kafka                Delete               Creating   13s
kafka-separated-cluster   kafka                Delete               Running    63s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kafka-separated-cluster -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kafka-separated-cluster-kafka-broker-0       2/2     Running   0          13m
kafka-separated-cluster-kafka-controller-0   2/2     Running   0          13m
kafka-separated-cluster-kafka-exporter-0     1/1     Running   0          12m
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your Kafka cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
