# Overview of KubeBlocks MongoDB Addon

MongoDB is a NoSQL document database designed for flexibility, scalability, and high performance. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents (BSON format), making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Supported Topologies

**replicaset**

A MongoDB replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same dataset, providing high availability and data redundancy. Replica sets are the foundation of MongoDB's fault tolerance and data reliability. By replicating data across multiple nodes, MongoDB ensures that if one server fails, another can take over seamlessly without affecting the application's availability.

In a replica set, there are typically three types of nodes:

- Primary Node: Handles all write operations and serves read requests by default.
- Secondary Nodes: Maintain copies of the primary's data and can optionally serve read requests.
- Arbiter Node: Participates in elections but does not store data. It is used to maintain an odd number of voting members in the replica set.

And it is recommended to create a cluster with at least **three** nodes to ensure high availability, one primary and two secondary nodes.

### Lifecycle Management

KubeBlocks simplifies MongoDB operations with comprehensive lifecycle management:

| Feature                      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scaling**       | Scale replicas in/out to adjust capacity                                   |
