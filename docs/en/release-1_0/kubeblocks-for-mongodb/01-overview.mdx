# Overview of KubeBlocks MongoDB Addon

MongoDB is a NoSQL document database designed for flexibility, scalability, and high performance. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents (BSON format), making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Supported Topologies

**replicaset**

A MongoDB replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same dataset, providing high availability and data redundancy. Replica sets are the foundation of MongoDB's fault tolerance and data reliability. By replicating data across multiple nodes, MongoDB ensures that if one server fails, another can take over seamlessly without affecting the application's availability.

In a replica set, there are typically three types of nodes:

- Primary Node: Handles all write operations and serves read requests by default.
- Secondary Nodes: Maintain copies of the primary's data and can optionally serve read requests.
- Arbiter Node: Participates in elections but does not store data. It is used to maintain an odd number of voting members in the replica set.

And it is recommended to create a cluster with at least **three** nodes to ensure high availability, one primary and two secondary nodes.

### Lifecycle Management

KubeBlocks simplifies MongoDB operations with comprehensive lifecycle management:

| Feature                      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scaling**       | Scale replicas in/out to adjust capacity                                   |
| **Vertical Scaling**         | Adjust CPU/memory resources for MongoDB instances                       |
| **Volume Expansion**         | Dynamically increase storage capacity without downtime                     |

| **Start/Stop**               | Temporarily suspend/resume cluster operations                              |
| **Password Management**      | Ability to set and manage custom root password for the MongoDB cluster during creation |
| **Custom Services**          | Expose specialized database endpoints                                      |
| **Switchover**               | Planned primary-replica role changes                                       |
| **Replica Management**       | Safely decommission or rebuild specific replicas                          |
| **Version Upgrades**         | Perform minor version upgrades seamlessly                                  |
| **Advanced Scheduling**      | Customize pod placement and resource allocation                           |
| **Monitoring**               | Integrated Prometheus metrics collection                                  |
| **Logging**                  | Centralized logs via Loki Stack                                           |


### Backup and Restore

KubeBlocks supports multiple backup strategies for MongoDB:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | dump   | Uses `mongodump`, a MongoDB utility used to create a binary export of the contents of a database  |
| Full Backup | datafile | Backup the data files of the database |
| Continuous Backup | archive-oplog | Continuously archives MongoDB oplog using `wal-g` |

### Supported Versions

KubeBlocks MongoDB Addon supports these MongoDB versions:

| Major Version | Supported Minor Versions       |
