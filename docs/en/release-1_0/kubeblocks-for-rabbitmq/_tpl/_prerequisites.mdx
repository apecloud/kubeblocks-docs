Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```
