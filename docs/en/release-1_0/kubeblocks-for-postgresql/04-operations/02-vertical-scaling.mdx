# Vertical Scaling for PostgreSQL Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a PostgreSQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU and memory) for PostgreSQL instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks orchestrates scaling with minimal impact:
1. Secondary replicas update first
2. Primary updates last after secondaries are healthy
3. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

import CreatePGCluster from '../_tpl/_create-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreatePGCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyPGCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyPGCluster />

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Secondary replicas are updated first (one at a time)
1. Primary is updated last after secondary replicas are healthy
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the postgresql component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: pg-cluster-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: pg-cluster
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: postgresql
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```
  What Happens During Vertical Scaling?
  - Secondary Pods are recreated first to ensure the primary Pod remains available.
  - Once all secondary Pods are updated, the primary Pod is restarted with the new resource configuration.


  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops pg-cluster-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                    TYPE              CLUSTER      STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   0/2        52s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   1/2        64s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   2/2        2m6s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   2/2        2m6s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Succeed   2/2        2m6s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: pg-cluster
      namespace: demo
    spec:
      terminationPolicy: Delete
      clusterDef: postgresql
      topology: replication
      componentSpecs:
        - name: postgresql
          serviceVersion: 16.4.0
          labels:
            apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
          disableExporter: true
          replicas: 2
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
              memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
            limits:
              cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
              memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          volumeClaimTemplates:
            - name: data
              spec:
                storageClassName: ""
                accessModes:
                  - ReadWriteOnce
                resources:
                  requests:
                    storage: 20Gi
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU-to-Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting PostgreSQL parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
kbcli cluster describe pg-cluster -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT    INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
postgresql                       1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      standard
```

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the PostgreSQL cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster pg-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the postgresql component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your PostgreSQL cluster remains performant and resilient.
