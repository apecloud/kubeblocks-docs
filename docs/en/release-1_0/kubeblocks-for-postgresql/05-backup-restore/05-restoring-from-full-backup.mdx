# Restore a PostgreSQL Cluster from Backup

This guide demonstrates two methods to restore a PostgreSQL cluster from backup in KubeBlocks:

1. **Cluster Annotation Method** - Simple declarative approach using YAML annotations
2. **OpsRequest API Method** - Enhanced operational control with progress monitoring

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Preparing for Restoration: Locate one Full Backup
Before restoring, ensure that there is a full backup available. The restoration process will use this backup to create a new PostgreSQL cluster.

- Backup repository accessible from new cluster
- Valid full backup in `Completed` state
- Adequate CPU/memory resources
- Sufficient storage capacity

Find available full backups:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Full,app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster # get the list of full backups
```

Pick ONE of the Backups whose status is `Completed`.

### Step 1: Create Restored Cluster
Create a new cluster with restore configuration:

Key parameters:
- `kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup` annotation
- Backup name and namespace located from the previous steps


```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: pg-restored
  namespace: demo
  annotations:
    # NOTE: replcae <FULL_BACKUP_NAME> with the backup name
    kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup: '{"postgresql":{"name":"<FULL_BACKUP_NAME>","namespace":"demo","volumeRestorePolicy":"Parallel"}}'
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: postgresql
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: postgresql
      serviceVersion: 16.4.0
      disableExporter: true
      labels:
        apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-restored-postgresql
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

### Step 3: Monitor Restoration
Track restore progress with:

```bash
# Watch restore status
kubectl get restore -n demo -w

# Watch cluster status
kubectl get cluster -n demo -w
```

:::note
Restore PostgreSQL cluster through `kbcli` or `OpsRequest` is not supported for now.

You can restore PostgreSQL cluster through `kubectl` as the steps above.

:::


## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the PostgreSQL cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster pg-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete cluster pg-cluster-restored -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary

This guide covered two restoration methods:

1. **Cluster Annotation** - Simple YAML-based approach
   - Retrieve system credentials
   - Create cluster with restore annotation
   - Monitor progress

2. **OpsRequest API** - Enhanced operational control
   - Create restore request
   - Track operation status
   - Verify completion
