# Setting Up a PostgreSQL Cluster with Scheduled Continuous Backup Enabled in KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to configure a PostgreSQL cluster on KubeBlocks with:

- Scheduled full backups (base backups)
- Continuous WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving
- Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities

This combination provides comprehensive data protection with minimal recovery point objectives (RPO).

## What is PITR?
Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) allows you to restore a database to a specific moment in time by combining full backups with continuous binlog/wal/archive log backups.

For details on restoring data from both full backups and continuous binlog backups, refer to the [Restore From PITR](restore-with-pitr.mdx)  guide.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Prerequisites for Backup

1. Backup Repository Configured:
   - Configured `BackupRepo`
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repo, `BackupRepo` status is `Ready`

2. Cluster is Running:
   - Cluster must be in `Running` state
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades etc.)


## List of Backup methods

KubeBlocks PostgreSQL supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Full Backup       | pg-basebackup   | Uses `pg_basebackup`, a PostgreSQL utility to create a base backup |
| Full Backup       | wal-g  | Uses `wal-g` to create a full backup (requires WAL-G configuration) |
| Continuous Backup | postgresql-pitr | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository|
| Continuous Backup | wal-g-archive | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository |


## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster with Backup APIs

Deploy a 2-node PostgreSQL replication cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary) and specify backup information.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: postgresql
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: postgresql
      serviceVersion: 16.4.0
      labels:
        apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
      disableExporter: true
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
  backup:
    retentionPeriod: 7d
    # for full backup
    method: pg-basebackup # full backup methnod name
    enabled: true
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * * # full backup scheuler
    # for continuous backup
    continuousMethod: archive-wal # continuous backup method
    pitrEnabled: true # enable continous method or not
    repoName: s3-repo # specify backuprepo, if not specified, the BackupRepo annotated as `default` will be used.
```

Or you can patch an existing cluster to enable scheduled continuous backup:
```bash
kubectl patch cluster pg-cluster -n demo --type='merge' -p='
{
  "spec": {
    "backup": {
      "retentionPeriod": "7d",
      "method": "pg-basebackup",
      "enabled": true,
      "cronExpression": "0 18 * * *",
      "continuousMethod": "archive-wal",
      "pitrEnabled": true,
      "repoName": "s3-repo"
    }
  }
}'
```

**Key Configuration Fields Explained**

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `backup.enabled` | `true` | Enables scheduled backups |
| `method` | `pg-basebackup` | Full backup method using PostgreSQL's native utility |
| `cronExpression` | `0 18 * * *` | Daily full backup at 6PM UTC |
| `retentionPeriod` | `7d` | Retains backups for 7 days |
| `repoName` | `s3-repo` | Backup repository name (S3-compatible storage) |
| `pitrEnabled` | `true` | Enables continuous WAL archiving for PITR |
| `continuousMethod` | `wal-g-archive` | Method for continuous WAL archiving |


## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Creating   50s
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Running    4m2s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your PostgreSQL cluster is ready for use.

## Monitoring Continuous Backups

Verify continuous backup operation with these commands:
```bash
# get continuous backup
kubectl get backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
# get stateful set working for continuous backup
kubectl get sts -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
# get pod working for continuous backup
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
```

## Verifying Backup Configuration

KubeBlocks automatically creates a `BackupSchedule` resource. Inspect the configuration:

```bash
kubectl get backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule  -n demo -oyaml
```

Example Output:
```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupSchedule
...
spec:
  backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
  schedules:
  - backupMethod: pg-basebackup
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * *
    enabled: true #
    retentionPeriod: 7d
  - backupMethod: archive-wal
    cronExpression: '*/5 * * * *'
    enabled: true
    name: archive-wal
    retentionPeriod: 7d
```

1. **Full Backups** (pg-basebackup):
   - Creates complete cluster snapshots
   - Runs on configured schedule (daily by default)
   - Serves as base for PITR

2. **Continuous Backups** (wal-g-archive):
   - Archives WAL logs every 5 minutes
   - Enables recovery to any point in time
   - Requires full backup as starting point


## Config WAL-G for Full Backup and Continuous Backup

:::note

If you want to use any backup methods powered by wal-g, such as wal-g-archive for continuous backup and wal-g for full backup, you need to configure wal-g in the cluster.

To configure wal-g, you need to trigger a `config-wal-g` backup ahead of time.
:::

To configure wal-g, you need to create a `Backup` resource with `config-wal-g` backup method. It is a special backup method that will create a wal-g configuration file for each replica in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster-config-wal-g
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backupMethod: config-wal-g
  backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

If you forget to configure wal-g ahead, you will see that Backups are `Failed` with the following error on backup pods:
```bash
fatal: unable to switch to directory: /home/postgres/pgdata/wal-g/env: file does not exist
```
