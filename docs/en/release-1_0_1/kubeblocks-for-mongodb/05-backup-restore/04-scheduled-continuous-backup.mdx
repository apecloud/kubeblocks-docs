# Setting Up a MongoDB Cluster with Scheduled Continuous Backup Enabled in KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to configure a MongoDB cluster on KubeBlocks with:

- Scheduled full backups (base backups)
- Continuous WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving
- Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities

This combination provides comprehensive data protection with minimal recovery point objectives (RPO).

## What is PITR?
Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) allows you to restore a database to a specific moment in time by combining full backups with continuous binlog/wal/archive log backups.

For details on restoring data from both full backups and continuous binlog backups, refer to the [Restore From PITR](restore-with-pitr.mdx)  guide.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Prerequisites for Backup

1. Backup Repository Configured:
   - Configured `BackupRepo`
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repo, `BackupRepo` status is `Ready`

2. Cluster is Running:
   - Cluster must be in `Running` state
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades etc.)

## List of Backup methods

KubeBlocks MongoDB supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | dump   | Uses `mongodump`, a MongoDB utility used to create a binary export of the contents of a database  |
| Full Backup | datafile | Backup the data files of the database |
| Continuous Backup | archive-oplog | Continuously archives MongoDB oplog using `wal-g` |

## Deploy a MongoDB ReplicaSet Cluster with Backup APIs

Deploy a MongoDB ReplicaSet Cluster with 3 replicas and specify backup information:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: mongo-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: mongodb
  topology: replicaset
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mongodb
      serviceVersion: "6.0.21"
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
  backup:
    retentionPeriod: 7d
    # for full backup
    method: datafile # full backup methnod name
    enabled: true
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * * # full backup scheuler
    # for continuous backup
    continuousMethod: archive-oplog # continuous backup method, paired with method wal-g
    pitrEnabled: true # enable continous method or not
    repoName: s3-repo # specify backuprepo, if not specified, the BackupRepo annotated as `default` will be used.
```

**Key Configuration Fields Explained**

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `backup.enabled` | `true` | Enables scheduled backups |
| `method` | `datafile` | Full backup method using PostgreSQL's native utility |
| `cronExpression` | `0 18 * * *` | Daily full backup at 6PM UTC |
| `retentionPeriod` | `7d` | Retains backups for 7 days |
| `repoName` | `s3-repo` | Backup repository name (S3-compatible storage) |
| `pitrEnabled` | `true` | Enables continuous WAL archiving for PITR |
| `continuousMethod` | `archive-oplog` | Method for continuous WAL archiving |


## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Monitoring Continuous Backups

Verify continuous backup operation with these commands:
```bash
# get continuous backup
kubectl get backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mongo-cluster,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
# get pod working for continuous backup
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mongo-cluster,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
```

## Verifying Backup Configuration

KubeBlocks automatically creates a `BackupSchedule` resource. Inspect the configuration:

```bash
kubectl get backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule  -n demo -oyaml
```

Example Output:
```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupSchedule
...
spec:
  backupPolicyName: mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-schedule
  schedules:
  - backupMethod: datafile
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * *
    enabled: true #
    retentionPeriod: 7d
  - backupMethod: archive-oplog
    cronExpression: '*/5 * * * *'
    enabled: true  # set to `true` to enable continuous backup
    retentionPeriod: 8d # set the retention period to your need
```

1. **Full Backups** (datafile):
  - Backup the data files of mongodb
  - Runs on configured schedule (daily by default)
  - Serves as base for PITR

2. **Continuous Backups** (archive-oplog):
  - Continuously archives MongoDB oplog using wal-g
  - Uses datasafed as storage backend with zstd compression
  - Maintains backup metadata including size and time ranges
  - Automatically purges expired backups
  - Verifies MongoDB primary status and process health

## Summary

This guide covered:
1. Configuring scheduled full backups with pg-basebackup
2. Enabling continuous WAL archiving with wal-g-archive
3. Setting up Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities
4. Monitoring backup operations

Key Benefits:
- Scheduled full backups ensure regular recovery points
- Continuous WAL archiving minimizes potential data loss
- PITR enables recovery to any moment in time
