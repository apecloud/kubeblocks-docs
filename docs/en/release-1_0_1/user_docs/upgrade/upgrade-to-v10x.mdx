# Upgrade to KubeBlocks v1.0.x

This guide walks you through upgrading KubeBlocks to version 1.0.x.

## Before You Begin

### Verify Your Current Version

First, check which version of KubeBlocks you're currently running:

```bash
# Using helm
helm -n kb-system list | grep kubeblocks

# Using kbcli
kbcli version
```

### Choose Your Upgrade Path

Select the appropriate upgrade path based on your current version:

| Current Version | Target: v1.0.x | Upgrade Path |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| v1.0.x | ✅ Direct upgrade | Follow [Upgrade from KubeBlocks v1.0.x](#upgrade-from-kubeblocks-v10x) |
| v0.9.x | ❌ Not supported | N/A |


## Upgrade from KubeBlocks v1.0.x

This section covers upgrading between v1.0.x versions (for example, from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1). Since these are patch releases within the same major version, the upgrade process is straightforward.

:::note
**Version Placeholder:**

Throughout this section, replace {LATEST_VERSION} with your target version number (e.g., `v1.0.1`).

  <TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm" default>

  **Step 1: Update Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**

  KubeBlocks separates CRDs from the Helm chart to reduce chart size. Start by updating the CRDs:

  <VersionedCodeBlock>
{`kubectl replace -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/{LATEST_VERSION}/kubeblocks_crds.yaml`}
  </VersionedCodeBlock>

  **Step 2: Upgrade KubeBlocks Core**

  First, update your Helm repository to get the latest chart information:
  ```bash
  helm repo add kubeblocks https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
  helm repo update kubeblocks
  ```

  Then upgrade KubeBlocks to the target version:
  <VersionedCodeBlock>
{`helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {LATEST_VERSION}`}
  </VersionedCodeBlock>

  **Step 3: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**

  :::note
  We are glad to announce that since KubeBlocks 1.0.0, each `ComponentDefinition` CR has its own version (usually the same as its Addon version), existing Clusters will not be affected by the Addon upgrade.

  But it is still recommended to test upgrade Addons in a non-production environment first.
  :::

  To upgrade Addons to the versions bundled with the new KubeBlocks version:

  <VersionedCodeBlock>
{`helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {LATEST_VERSION}  --set upgradeAddons=true`}
  </VersionedCodeBlock>

  Or you want to upgrade specific Addons follow the steps in [Upgrade Addons](../references/install-addons#upgrade-addons)

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli">

  **Step 1: Update kbcli**

  Download and install the matching version of kbcli:

  <VersionedCodeBlock>
{`curl -fsSL https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh | bash -s {LATEST_VERSION}`}
  </VersionedCodeBlock>

  **Step 2: Upgrade KubeBlocks Core**

  Perform the core upgrade without updating Addons:

  <VersionedCodeBlock>
{`kbcli kb upgrade --version {LATEST_VERSION}`}
  </VersionedCodeBlock>

  **Step 3: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**
