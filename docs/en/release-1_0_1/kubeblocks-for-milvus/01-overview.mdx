# Overview of KubeBlocks Milvus Addon

Milvus is an open source (Apache-2.0 licensed) vector database built to power embedding similarity search and AI applications. Milvus's architecture is designed to handle large-scale vector datasets and includes various deployment modes:  Milvus Standalone, and Milvus Distributed, to accommodate different data scale needs.

## Key Features

### Supported Topologies

Milvus supports two deployment modes to accommodate different scale requirements:

#### Standalone Mode

A lightweight deployment suitable for development and testing:

- **Milvus Core**: Provides vector search and database functionality
- **Metadata Storage (ETCD)**: Stores cluster metadata and configuration
- **Object Storage (MinIO/S3)**: Persists vector data and indexes

#### Cluster Mode

A distributed deployment for production workloads with multiple specialized components:

**Access Layer**

- Stateless proxies that handle client connections and request routing

**Compute Layer**

- Query Nodes: Execute search operations
- Data Nodes: Handle data ingestion and compaction
- Index Nodes: Build and maintain vector indexes

**Coordination Layer**

- Root Coordinator: Manages global metadata
- Query Coordinator: Orchestrates query execution
- Data Coordinator: Manages data distribution
- Index Coordinator: Oversees index building

**Storage Layer**

- Metadata Storage (ETCD): Cluster metadata and configuration
- Object Storage (MinIO/S3): Persistent vector data storage
- Log Storage (Pulsar): Message queue for change data capture


### Lifecycle Management

KubeBlocks simplifies Milvus operations with comprehensive lifecycle management:
