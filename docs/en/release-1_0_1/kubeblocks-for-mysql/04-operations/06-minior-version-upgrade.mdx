# Upgrading the Minor Version of a MySQL Cluster in KubeBlocks

This guide walks you through the deployment and minor version upgrade of a MySQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks, ensuring minimal downtime during the process.

To minimize the impact on database availability, the upgrade process starts with the replicas (secondary instances). Once the replicas are upgraded, a switchover operation promotes one of the upgraded replicas to primary. The switchover process is very fast, typically completing in a few hundred milliseconds. After the switchover, the original primary instance is upgraded, ensuring minimal disruption to the application.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

Deploy a 2-node semi-sync MySQL cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary):

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

## Verifying the Deployment
Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo -w
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME                     CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Creating   8s
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running    2m41s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your MySQL cluster is ready for use.

## List All Available MySQL Versions

Use the following command to display the MySQL versions supported by your KubeBlocks installation:
```bash
kubectl get cmpv mysql
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME    VERSIONS                                                                                         STATUS      AGE
mysql   8.4.2,8.4.1,8.4.0,8.0.39,8.0.38,8.0.37,8.0.36,8.0.35,8.0.34,8.0.33,8.0.32,8.0.31,8.0.30,5.7.44   Available   11d
```
Note: The list of supported versions may vary depending on your KubeBlocks version.

## Upgrading the MySQL Version

### Identify the Current Primary and Secondary Instances
Run the following command to identify the roles of the cluster instances:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
```
Expected Output:
```bash
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0	primary
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1	secondary
```

### Apply the Upgrade
To upgrade the MySQL version, modify the serviceVersion field in the Cluster resource. In this example, we will upgrade the MySQL version from 8.0.35 to 8.0.39:
```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.39      # Update version from 8.0.35 to 8.0.39
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

### Monitor the Upgrade Process
During the upgrade, observe the changes in the cluster's Pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          97s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          50s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   3/4     Running   2 (2s ago)   68s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   2 (6s ago)   2m6s
```
**Key Observations:**
- The replica ('example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1') is upgraded first.
- A switchover operation occurs, making the replica the new primary.
- Finally, the original primary ('example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0') is upgraded.

After the upgrade is completed, roles are switched:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubeblocks\.io/role}{"\n"}{end}'
```
Updated Roles:
```bash
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0	secondary
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1	primary
```

## Verification

### Check Cluster Status
Ensure the cluster is in the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   17m
```

### Verify the MySQL Version
Retrieve the MySQL root credentials:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
Expected Output:
```bash
79vJW1Vg43
```

Connect to the upgraded instances and verify the MySQL version:
```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1 -- mysql -uroot -p79vJW1Vg43 -e "SELECT VERSION();"
```
Example Output:
```sql
+-----------+
| VERSION() |
+-----------+
| 8.0.39    |
+-----------+
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
- Deploy a MySQL semi-synchronous cluster using KubeBlocks.
- Perform a rolling upgrade of the MySQL minor version with minimal downtime.
- Verify that the upgrade was successful.

This rolling upgrade strategy ensures high availability by upgrading the replicas first, performing a switchover, and then upgrading the original primary instance.
