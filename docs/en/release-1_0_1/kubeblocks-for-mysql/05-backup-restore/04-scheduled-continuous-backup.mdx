# Setting Up a MySQL Cluster with Scheduled Continuous Backup Enabled in KubeBlocks

This guide explains how to deploy a MySQL cluster on KubeBlocks with scheduled full backups and continuous binlog backups, enabling Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) for enhanced data protection and recovery capabilities.

## What is PITR?
Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) allows you to restore a database to a specific moment in time by combining full backups with incremental binlog backups.

For details on restoring data from both full backups and continuous binlog backups, refer to the [Restore From PITR](restore-with-pitr.mdx)  guide.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MySQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MySQL cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) in semi-synchronous mode, along with scheduled backups (both full backup and continuous backup).

Cluster Configuration
```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
  backup:
    enabled: true
    retentionPeriod: 30d
    method: xtrabackup
    cronExpression: '0 0 * * *'
    repoName: s3-repo
    pitrEnabled: true
EOF
```

**Explanation of Key Fields**
- `terminationPolicy: WipeOut`:
  - When set to 'WipeOut', deleting the cluster also deletes all associated data, including backups.
  - For production environments, it is recommended to use `terminationPolicy: Delete`, which retains backup data even after the cluster is deleted.
- `backup.enabled: true`: Enables scheduled backups for the cluster.
- `method: xtrabackup`: Specifies the backup tool to be used (e.g., Percona XtraBackup).
- `cronExpression: '0 0 * * *'`: Configures the backup schedule to run daily at midnight (UTC).
- `retentionPeriod: 30d`: Retains backups for 30 days.
- `repoName: s3-repo`: Specifies the S3 repository for storing backups.
- `pitrEnabled: true`: Enables Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR).

## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to Running:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   38s
```
Once the status is Running, the MySQL cluster is successfully deployed.

## Check the BackupSchedule Resource

KubeBlocks automatically creates a BackupSchedule resource when scheduled backups are enabled. Verify the configuration using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get backupschedule example-mysql-cluster-mysql-backup-schedule  -n demo -oyaml
```

Example Output:
```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupSchedule
...
spec:
  backupPolicyName: example-mysql-cluster-mysql-backup-policy
  schedules:
    - backupMethod: xtrabackup
      cronExpression: 0 0 * * *
      enabled: true
      name: xtrabackup
      retentionPeriod: 30d
    - backupMethod: archive-binlog
      cronExpression: '*/30 * * * *'
      enabled: true
      name: archive-binlog
      retentionPeriod: 30d
```
**Explanation**:
- The xtrabackup schedule performs a full backup daily at midnight (UTC).
- The archive-binlog schedule performs incremental backups by archiving binlogs every 30 minutes.

With this setup, a combination of full and incremental backups ensures robust data protection and enables PITR.

## Validate Backup in S3 Repository

After the scheduled backup task has been executed, verify the backup files in the configured S3 bucket with the following command:

```bash
TZ=":UTC" aws s3 ls s3://kubeblocks-backup-repo/ --recursive
```

Example Output:
```bash
TZ=":UTC" aws s3 ls s3://kubeblocks-backup-repo/ --recursive

```
This output confirms that:
- Binlog archives are uploaded every 30 minutes.
- Full and incremental backups are stored in the specified S3 repository, ensuring continuous data protection.


## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
- Deploy a MySQL cluster with semi-synchronous replication in KubeBlocks, enable scheduled full backups and continuous incremental backups.
- Verify backup schedules and validate backup files in an S3 repository.
With this setup, your MySQL cluster is protected with PITR capabilities, allowing you to restore the database to any specific point in time with minimal data loss.
