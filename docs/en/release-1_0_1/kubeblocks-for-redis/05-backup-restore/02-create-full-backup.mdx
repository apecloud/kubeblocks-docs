# Create a Full Backup for Redis on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to create and validate full backups for Redis clusters on KubeBlocks using the `pg-basebackup` method through both:
- The Backup API (direct backup operations)
- The OpsRequest API (managed backup operations with enhanced monitoring)

We will cover how to restore data from a backup in the [Restore From Full Backup](./05-restoring-from-full-backup) guide.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Redis Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Backup Prerequisites

Before creating backups, ensure:
1. Backup repository is configured:
   - `BackupRepo` resource exists
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repository
   - `BackupRepo` status shows "Ready"

2. Cluster is ready:
   - Cluster status is "Running"
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades, etc.)

## Identify Backup Configuration

Check available backup policies and schedules:

```bash
# List backup policies
kubectl get backuppolicy -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication

# List backup schedules
kubectl get backupschedule -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                                    BACKUP-REPO   STATUS      AGE
redis-replication-redis-backup-policy                 Available   17m

NAME                                              STATUS      AGE
redis-replication-redis-backup-schedule           Available   60m
```

View supported backup methods in the BackupPolicy CR 'redis-replication-redis-backup-policy':

```bash
kubectl get backuppolicy redis-replication-redis-backup-policy -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec.backupMethods[].name'
```
**List of Backup methods**

KubeBlocks Redis supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | datafile  | Uses `redis-cli BGSAVE` command to backup data |
| Continuous Backup | aof | Continuously perform incremental backups by archiving Append-Only Files (AOF) |

## Backup via Backup API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

The `datafile` method uses redis `BGSAVE` command to perform a full backup and  upload backup file using `datasafed push`.

Apply this manifest to create a backup:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: redis-backup-datafile
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backupMethod: datafile
  backupPolicyName: redis-replication-redis-backup-policy
  # Determines whether the backup contents stored in the backup repository should be deleted
  # when the backup custom resource(CR) is deleted. Supported values are `Retain` and `Delete`.
  # - `Retain` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are kept.
  # - `Delete` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are deleted.
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### 2. Monitor Backup and Verify Completion

Track progress until status shows "Completed":

```bash
kubectl get backup redis-backup-datafile  -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME                    POLICY                                  METHOD     REPO            STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
redis-backup-datafile   redis-replication-redis-backup-policy   datafile   <BACKUP_REPO>   Completed   3412         10s        Delete            2025-05-17T09:24:59Z   2025-05-17T09:25:08Z
```

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Check files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Backup file size


## Backup via OpsRequest API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

Execute a backup using the OpsRequest API with the 'pg-basebackup' method:

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: redis-replication-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: redis-replication
  force: false
  backup:
    backupPolicyName: redis-replication-redis-backup-policy
    backupMethod: datafile
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    retentionPeriod: 1mo
  type: Backup
```

### 2. Monitor Backup Progress

#### 1. Monitor Operation Status

Track backup progress in real-time:
```bash
kubectl get ops redis-replication-backup  -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                       TYPE     CLUSTER             STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
redis-replication-backup   Backup   redis-replication   Succeed   -/-        35s
```

- A STATUS of 'Succeed' indicates the backup operation completed successfully.

#### 2. Verify Completion

Check the final backup status:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l operations.kubeblocks.io/ops-name=redis-replication-backup
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                                           POLICY                                  METHOD     REPO            STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
backup-demo-redis-replication-20250517092706   redis-replication-redis-backup-policy   datafile   <BACKUP_REPO>   Completed   3458         10s        Delete            2025-05-17T09:27:06Z   2025-05-17T09:27:16Z   2025-06-16T09:27:16Z
```

- The backup status should show 'Completed'.

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Other metadata

## Summary

This guide covered:
1. Deploying a replication Redis cluster
2. Creating full backups using:
   - Direct Backup API
   - Managed OpsRequest API
