# PostgreSQL Cluster Switchover

A **switchover** is a planned operation that transfers the primary role from one PostgreSQL instance to another. Unlike failover which occurs during failures, switchover provides:
- Controlled role transitions
- Minimal downtime (typically a few hundred milliseconds)
- Predictable maintenance windows

Switchover is ideal for:
- Node maintenance/upgrades
- Workload rebalancing
- Testing high availability
- Planned infrastructure changes

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

import CreatePGCluster from '../_tpl/_create-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreatePGCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyPGCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyPGCluster />

## Check Roles
List the Pods and their roles (primary or secondary):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster -L kubeblocks.io/role
```

Example Output:

```text
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   0          9m59s   primary
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   4/4     Running   0          11m     secondary
```

## Performing a Planned Switchover

To initiate a planned switchover, create an OpsRequest resource as shown below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Automatic Switchover" label="Automatic Switchover" default>
  Option 1: Automatic Switchover (No preferred candidate)

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: pg-switchover-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: pg-cluster
    type: Switchover
    switchover:
    - componentName: postgresql
      instanceName: pg-cluster-postgresql-0
  ```
 **Key Parameters:**
  - `instanceName`: Specifies the instance (Pod) that is primary or leader before a switchover operation.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Targeted Switchover" label="Targeted Switchover" >
  Option 2: Targeted Switchover (Specific candidate)

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: pg-switchover-targeted
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: pg-cluster
    type: Switchover
    switchover:
    - componentName: postgresql
      # Specifies the instance whose role will be transferred.
      # A typical usage is to transfer the leader role in a consensus system.
      instanceName: pg-cluster-postgresql-0
      # If CandidateName is specified, the role will be transferred to this instance.
      # The name must match one of the pods in the component.
      # Refer to ComponentDefinition's Swtichover lifecycle action for more details.
      candidateName: pg-cluster-postgresql-1
  ```

  **Key Parameters:**
  - `instanceName`: Specifies the instance (Pod) that is primary or leader before a switchover operation.
  - `candidateName`: If candidate name is specified, the role will be transferred to this instance.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Monitoring the Switchover

Monitor the switchover progress:

```bash
kubectl get ops pg-switchover-ops -n demo -w
```

Expected Result:
```bash
NAME                TYPE         CLUSTER      STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
pg-switchover-ops   Switchover   pg-cluster   Succeed   1/1        17s
```
## Verify the Switchover

After the switchover is executed, the specified instance will be promoted to the primary role, while the previously primary instance will take on the secondary role.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster -L kubeblocks.io/role
```

Expected Output:

```text
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   0          19m59s  secondary
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   4/4     Running   0          21m     primary
```

In this example:
- Pod 'pg-cluster-postgresql-1' has been promoted to the primary role.
- Pod 'pg-cluster-postgresql-0' has transitioned to the secondary role.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Switchover Issues

If the switchover operation gets stuck, check these resources:
```bash
# Check agent logs on both current primary and candidate
kubectl logs -n demo <primary-pod> -c kbagent
kubectl logs -n demo <candidate-pod> -c kbagent

# Check cluster events for errors
kubectl get events -n demo --field-selector involvedObject.name=pg-cluster

# Check kubeblocks logs
kubectl -n kb-system logs deploy/kubeblocks
```

## Summary

This guide demonstrated how to:
1. Deploy a PostgreSQL HA cluster
2. Perform both automatic and targeted Switchover
3. Verify role transitions

**Key takeaways:**
- Switchover enables controlled maintenance with minimal downtime (~100-500ms)
- KubeBlocks provides declarative operations for reliable role transitions
- Always verify:
  - Cluster status immediately after switchover
  - Application connectivity
  - Replication health
- Check logs for troubleshooting:
  - KubeBlocks operator (kb-system namespace)
  - kbagent on database pods
