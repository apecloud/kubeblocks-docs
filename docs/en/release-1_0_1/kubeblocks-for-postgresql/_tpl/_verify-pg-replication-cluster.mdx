Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:

```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Creating   50s
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Running    4m2s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your PostgreSQL cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
