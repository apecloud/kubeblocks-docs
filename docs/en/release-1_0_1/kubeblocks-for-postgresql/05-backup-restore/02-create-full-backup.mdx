# Create a Full Backup for PostgreSQL on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to create and validate full backups for PostgreSQL clusters on KubeBlocks using the `pg-basebackup` method through both:
- The Backup API (direct backup operations)
- The OpsRequest API (managed backup operations with enhanced monitoring)

We will cover how to restore data from a backup in the [Restore From Full Backup](./05-restoring-from-full-backup) guide.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

import CreatePGCluster from '../_tpl/_create-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreatePGCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyPGCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyPGCluster />

## Backup Prerequisites

Before creating backups, ensure:
1. Backup repository is configured:
   - `BackupRepo` resource exists
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repository
   - `BackupRepo` status shows "Ready"

2. Cluster is ready:
   - Cluster status is "Running"
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades, etc.)

## Identify Backup Configuration

Check available backup policies and schedules:

```bash
# List backup policies
kubectl get backuppolicy -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster

# List backup schedules
kubectl get backupschedule -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                                            BACKUP-REPO   STATUS      AGE
pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy                           Available   58m

NAME                                              STATUS      AGE
pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule             Available   60m
```
### BackupPolicy

`BackupPolicy` defines a list of backup methods and their configurations. KubeBlocks automatically generates a `BackupPolicy` for each database cluster if it supports backup (`BackupPolicyTemplate` is defined).

:::tip
To view the list of BackupPolicyTemplate, you can run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get backuppolicytemplate -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql
```
:::

View supported backup methods in the BackupPolicy CR `pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy`:

```bash
kubectl get backuppolicy pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec.backupMethods[] | .actionSetName + ", " + .name'
```

Example Output:

| ActionSet Name                | Method Name        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| postgresql-basebackup         | pg-basebackup      |
| null                          | volume-snapshot    |
| postgresql-wal-g              | wal-g              |
| postgres-wal-g-incremental    | wal-g-incremental  |
| postgresql-for-pitr           | archive-wal        |
| postgres-wal-g-pitr           | wal-g-archive      |


- `ActionSetName` refers to the name of the `ActionSet` object that defines the backup and restore actions. If `ActionSetName` is `null`, it means the backup method does not require an `ActionSet`
- `Method Name` is simply a name of the backup method given by users or defined in the `BackupPolicyTemplate`. It will be referenced by the `BackupSchedule` resource.

:::tip

To check the definition of the `ActionSet` object, you can run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get actionset postgresql-wal-g  -oyaml  # where postgresql-basebackup is the ActionSetName
```

**List of Backup methods**

KubeBlocks PostgreSQL supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Full Backup       | pg-basebackup   | Uses `pg_basebackup`, a PostgreSQL utility to create a base backup |
| Full Backup       | wal-g           | Uses `wal-g` to create a full backup (requires WAL-G configuration) |
| Continuous Backup | archive-wal     | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `pg-basebackup`|
| Continuous Backup | wal-g-archive   | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `wal-g`|

:::note

- It is recommended to pair `pg-basebackup` with `archive-wal`, and pair `wal-g` with `wal-g-archive`.
- Method `pg-basebackup` can be enabled alone to create a full backup.
- Method `wal-g` cannot be enabled alone. It must be paired with `wal-g-archive`.

:::

### BackupSchedule

`BackupSchedule` defines a schedule for backups. It references the `BackupPolicy` resource and the `BackupMethod` name.

View the `BackupSchedule` resource `pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule`:

```bash
kubectl get backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec.schedules[] | .backupMethod + "," + .enabled'
```

Example Output:

| Backup Method        | Enabled |
|----------------------|---------|
| pg-basebackup        | false   |
| wal-g                | false   |
| archive-wal          | false   |
| wal-g-archive        | false   |

By default, all backup methods are disabled. You can enable it by setting `enabled` to `true` on demand. As introduced previously, there are two `FULL` backup methods: `pg-basebackup` and `wal-g`. As `wal-g` cannot be enabled alone, we use `pg-basebackup` in this guide.

## Step 1. Create On-Demand Backup (using pg-basebackup)
Backup via Backup API

### Option 1. Using Backup API

Apply this manifest to create a backup:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster-pg-basebackup2
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backupMethod: pg-basebackup
  backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
  # Determines whether the backup contents stored in the backup repository should be deleted
  # when the backup custom resource(CR) is deleted. Supported values are `Retain` and `Delete`.
  # - `Retain` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are kept.
  # - `Delete` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are deleted.
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### Option 2. Using OpsRequest API

Execute a backup using the OpsRequest API with the 'pg-basebackup' method:

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: pg-cluster
  force: false
  backup:
    backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
    backupMethod: pg-basebackup
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    retentionPeriod: 1mo
  type: Backup
```


## Step 2. Monitor Backup and Verify Completion

You can track the Backup progress until status shows "Completed".

```bash
kubectl get backup pg-cluster-pg-basebackup  -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME                       POLICY                                METHOD          REPO            STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
pg-cluster-pg-basebackup   pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy   pg-basebackup   <BACKUP_REPO>   Completed   4722262      10s        Delete            2025-05-16T02:53:45Z   2025-05-16T02:53:55Z
```

## Step 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Check files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details in `.status` including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Backup file size

## Troubleshooting

When encountering backup issues, such as Backup status is `Failed`  or stuck in `Running`for quite a long time, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the problem:

1. Inspect the Backup resource for any error events or status updates:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe backup <BACKUP_NAME> -n demo
  ```

2. Verify the backup job status and examine its logs:
  KubeBlocks runs a Job to create a full backup. If the backup task gets stuck, you can track the Job progress:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get job -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster,app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=kubeblocks-dataprotection
  ```

  And check pod logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo logs <POD_NAME>
  ```

  This job will be deleted when the backup completes.

3. Review KubeBlocks controller logs for detailed error information:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n kb-system logs deploy/kubeblocks -f
  ```

## Summary

This guide covered:
1. Deploying a replication PostgreSQL cluster
2. Creating full backups using:
   - Direct Backup API
   - Managed OpsRequest API
3. Monitoring and validating backups

Your PostgreSQL data is now securely backed up and ready for restoration when needed.
