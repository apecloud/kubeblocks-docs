# Community Monthly Report for April 2024

## Overview

In April, KubeBlocks continued the development of v0.9.0. The new version is expected to be released in May, so stay tuned üåü.

Over the past month, the community has participated in six offline events, merged 157 PRs, and resolved 133 issues, with contributions from 27 developers. What's more, KubeBlocks and WeScale have announced their participation in OSPP 2024 (Open Source Promotion Plan) and the projects are now open for student registration. For more details, refer to:

- [KubeBlocks Community Homepage](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/orgdetail/833ca537-91a2-44a8-9965-5eee8f34aceb?lang=en)
- [WeScale Community Homepage](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/orgdetail/5d8efb0a-7f0d-4705-b253-00bb162ef507?lang=en)

So far, KubeBlocks has grabbed 1.7k stars. Thanks for all the support.

## Highlights

- Supported saving backup CRs to a backup repo, allowing users to manually restore the cluster using the saved files (#7002).
- Supported ServiceRef to reference new API objects, decoupling it from ConnCredential (#7006).
- RSM supported in-place updates of Pods by adding the ability to retrieve Kubernetes versions, updating the Pod template revision generation algorithm, and supporting the IgnorePodVerticalScaling switch (#7000).
- Supported cluster RuntimeClassName configuration (#7001).
- Supported specific instance scale-down, useful for scenarios such as node failures, data corruption, or instance unavailability (#6958).
- Supported overridable component services in the cluster API (#6934).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the cluster was always in the "Deleting" state after upgrading from v0.8.2 to v0.9 (#6985).
- Fixed the issue where the cluster was always in the "Updating" state after vscale (#6971).
- Fixed the issue where stop/hscale OpsRequests were always running in v0.9 (#6972).
