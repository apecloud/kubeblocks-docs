# Deploying a Redis Sharding Cluster (Cluster Mode) with KubeBlocks

Redis Cluster distributes data across multiple nodes (shards) using hash-based partitioning, allowing horizontal scaling for both reads and writes.

**Use Cases**
- Large-scale applications requiring high throughput.
- Distributed caching and session storage.
- Write-heavy workloads (e.g., real-time analytics).

## Deploying the Redis Sharding Cluster

To create a redis sharding cluster (cluster mode)  with 3 shards, and 2 replica for each shard:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: redis-sharding
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  shardings:
  - name: shard  # the name of the shard
    shards: 3  # the number of shards to create for the cluster
    template:
      name: redis
      componentDef: redis-cluster-7 # the name of the component definition for each shard
      replicas: 2 # replicas is the number of replicas to create for each shard
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '1'
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '1'
          memory: 1Gi
      serviceVersion: 7.2.4
      volumeClaimTemplates:
      - name: data
        spec:
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 20Gi
      services:
      # The service `redis-advertised` is defined in `ComponentDefinition`
      # and it is used to parse the advertised endpoints of the Redis pods.
      - name: redis-advertised # This is a per-pod svc, and will be used to parse advertised endpoints
        podService: true
        #  - NodePort
        #  - LoadBalancer
        serviceType: NodePort
```

**Key Configuration Details**:
- `shardings`: Specifies a list of `ShardingSpec` objects that configure the sharding topology for components of a Cluster.
- `shards`: Specifies the number of shards to create for the cluster.
- `serviceType`: Specifies the service type of `redis-advertised` service, which is used to parse the advertised endpoints of the Redis pods.
   By default, the service type is `NodePort`. If you want to expose the service to the outside of the cluster, you can override the service type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` depending on your need.

:::tip

A Redis cluster needs a minimum of **three** master nodes to ensure high availability and prevent data inconsistency.

A production-ready Redis Cluster is typically recommended to have at least six nodes: three masters for sharding and failover consensus, and three replicas to act as backups for each master.

When creating or scaling-in redis clusters, make sure the `shards` is greater than or equal to **3**.

## Verifying the Deployment

### Check the Cluster Status
Once the cluster is deployed, check its status:
```bash
kubectl get cluster redis-sharding  -n demo -w
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
redis-sharding                        Delete               Running   103s
```

### Verify Component and Pod Status

Get all components working for this cluster:
```bash
kubectl get cmp -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-sharding -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                       DEFINITION                      SERVICE-VERSION   STATUS    AGE
redis-sharding-shard-5cd   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
redis-sharding-shard-drg   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
redis-sharding-shard-tgf   redis-cluster-7-1.0.0           7.2.4             Running   2m34s
```
Each component stands for a shard, with hash id as suffix.

Check pods and their roles

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-sharding -L  kubeblocks.io/role -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
redis-sharding-shard-5cd-0   2/2     Running   0          3m55s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-5cd-1   2/2     Running   0          3m35s   secondary
redis-sharding-shard-drg-0   2/2     Running   0          3m53s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-drg-1   2/2     Running   0          3m35s   secondary
redis-sharding-shard-tgf-0   2/2     Running   0          3m54s   primary
redis-sharding-shard-tgf-1   2/2     Running   0          3m36s   secondary
```
There are in-total six replicas in the cluster, two (one primarily and one secondary) for each component.

## Scaling Shards

### Scaling-Out Shards (Add Shards)
**Expected Workflow**:

1. A new Component is provisioned with two replicas, one primary and one secondary.
2. Cluster status changes from `Updating` to `Running` when all the components are ready (status is `Running`).

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="opsRequest" label="OpsRequest API" default>

  Option 1: Using Horizontal Scaling OpsRequest

  To increase the number of shards to `4`, you can use the following OpsRequest:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: redis-sharding-scale-out-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: redis-sharding
    type: HorizontalScaling
    horizontalScaling:
    - componentName: shard
      shards: 4
  ```

  Monitor the progress of the scaling operation:

  ```bash
  kubectl get ops redis-sharding-scale-out-ops -n demo -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                           TYPE                CLUSTER          STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  redis-sharding-scale-out-ops   HorizontalScaling   redis-sharding   Running   0/1          35s
  redis-sharding-scale-out-ops   HorizontalScaling   redis-sharding   Succeed   1/1        2m35s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ClusterAPI" label="Cluster API">

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you can perform a direct update to the `shards` field in the Cluster resource:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: shard
        shards: 4
  # remaining fields are the same as the original cluster CR, omited for brevity
  ...
  ```

  Or you can patch the cluster CR with command:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch cluster redis-sharding -n demo --type=json -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/shardings/0/shards", "value": 4}]'
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Similar to scaling-out, you can also scale-in the cluster by decreasing the `shards` field in the Cluster resource. But make sure the `shards` is greater than or equal to 3.

## Switchover

To switchover a shard, named `redis-sharding-shard-5cd` for example, you can use the following OpsRequest:

```yaml
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: redis-sharding-switchover-ops
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: redis-sharding  # redis-sharding is the name of the cluster
  switchover:
  - componentObjectName: redis-sharding-shard-5cd  # componentObjectName is the name of one of the shards
    candidateName: redis-sharding-shard-5cd-0  # candidateName is the name of the candidate instance
    instanceName: redis-sharding-shard-5cd-1  # instanceName is the name of the primary instance
  type: Switchover
```

:::note

`componentObjectName` is the name of one of the shards, which is the full name of the component object.

## Cleanup
To remove all resources created during this tutorial:
