# Overview of KubeBlocks Kafka Addon

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to build real-time pipelines and can be used as a message broker or as a replacement for a log aggregation solution for big data applications.

- A broker is a Kafka server that stores data and handles requests from producers and consumers. Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers, each identified by a unique ID. Brokers work together to distribute and replicate data across the cluster.
- KRaft was introduced in Kafka 3.3.1 in October 2022 as an alternative to Zookeeper. A subset of brokers are designated as controllers, and these controllers provide the consensus services that used to be provided by Zookeeper.
