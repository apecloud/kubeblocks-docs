# Vertical Scaling for Kafka  Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a Kafka  Cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU and memory) for Kafka instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks ensures minimal impact during scaling operations by following a controlled, role-aware update strategy:
**Role-Aware Replicas (Primary/Secondary Replicas)**
- Secondary replicas update first – Non-leader pods are upgraded to minimize disruption.
- Primary updates last – Only after all secondaries are healthy does the primary pod restart.
- Cluster state progresses from Updating → Running once all replicas are stable.

**Role-Unaware Replicas (Ordinal-Based Scaling)**
If replicas have no defined roles, updates follow Kubernetes pod ordinal order:
- Highest ordinal first (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0) to ensure deterministic rollouts.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Kafka  Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Pods are updated in pod ordinal order, from highest to lowest, (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0)
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the kafka-broker component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: kafka-separated-cluster
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: kafka-broker
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```

  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:

  ```bash
  NAME                                 TYPE              CLUSTER                   STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   kafka-separated-cluster   Running   0/1        12s
  kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   kafka-separated-cluster   Running   1/1        13s
  kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   kafka-separated-cluster   Running   1/1        13s
  kafka-separated-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   kafka-separated-cluster   Succeed   1/1        13s
  ```

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: kafka-broker
        replicas: 1
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          limits:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
    ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU-to-Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting Kafka parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
kbcli cluster describe kafka-separated-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT          INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
kafka-broker                           1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      <none>
```

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Kafka  Cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster kafka-separated-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a Kafka  Cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the kafka component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your Kafka  Cluster remains performant and resilient.
