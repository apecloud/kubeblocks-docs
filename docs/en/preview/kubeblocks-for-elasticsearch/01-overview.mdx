# Overview of KubeBlocks Elasticsearch Addon

## Overview

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search engine optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Each Elasticsearch cluster consists of one or more nodes, with each node assuming specific roles.

### Node Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **master** | Manages cluster state and coordinates operations |
| **data** | Stores data and handles data-related operations |
| **data_content** | Stores document data |
| **data_hot** | Handles recent, frequently accessed data |
| **data_warm** | Stores less frequently accessed data |
| **data_cold** | Handles rarely accessed data |
| **data_frozen** | Manages archived data |
| **ingest** | Processes documents before indexing |
| **ml** | Runs machine learning jobs |
| **remote_cluster_client** | Connects to remote clusters |
| **transform** | Handles data transformations |
