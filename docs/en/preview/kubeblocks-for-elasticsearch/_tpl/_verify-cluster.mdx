Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster es-multinode -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:

```bash
NAME           CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
es-multinode                        Delete               Creating   10s
es-multinode                        Delete               Updating   41s
es-multinode                        Delete               Running    42s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=es-multinode -n demo
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
es-multinode-data-0     4/4     Running   0          6m21s
es-multinode-data-1     4/4     Running   0          6m21s
es-multinode-data-2     4/4     Running   0          6m21s
es-multinode-master-0   4/4     Running   0          6m21s
es-multinode-master-1   4/4     Running   0          6m21s
es-multinode-master-2   4/4     Running   0          6m21s
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your Elasticsearch cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
