# KubeBlocks for ClickHouse

## Introduction

ClickHouse is a high-performance, column-oriented OLAP database management system developed by Yandex and open-sourced in 2016. It excels in real-time analytics and handles petabyte-scale data with millisecond query latencies.

### Key Features

- **Columnar Storage**: Optimized for analytical queries with high compression rates
- **Vectorized Query Execution**: Processes data in batches for maximum CPU efficiency
- **MergeTree Engine Family**: Advanced table engines with partitioning and indexing
- **Distributed Architecture**: Native support for sharding and replication
- **SQL Support**: Full SQL support with extensions for analytical functions

## Why ClickHouse on Kubernetes?

While ClickHouse offers exceptional performance, deploying and managing it in production environments presents several challenges:

### Operational Challenges

1. **Complex Distributed Setup**: Configuring shards, replicas, and ClickHouse Keeper/ZooKeeper
2. **Manual Scaling**: Adding or removing nodes requires careful coordination
3. **Configuration Management**: Managing complex XML configurations across nodes
4. **High Availability**: Implementing failover and recovery mechanisms
5. **Backup and Recovery**: Coordinating backups across distributed shards

### KubeBlocks Solution

KubeBlocks provides a comprehensive solution for running ClickHouse on Kubernetes:

- **Automated Deployment**: One-command deployment of production-ready clusters
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated scaling, upgrades, and configuration updates
- **High Availability**: Built-in leader election and automatic failover
- **Backup & Recovery**: Integrated backup solutions with S3 support
- **Unified API**: Consistent management interface across different database engines

## Architecture Overview

KubeBlocks implements ClickHouse using a modular architecture:

### Components

1. **ClickHouse Server**: The main database component with sharding support
2. **ClickHouse Keeper**: Distributed coordination service (Raft-based alternative to ZooKeeper)

### Deployment Modes

- **Standalone**: Single-node deployment for development and testing
- **Cluster**: Multi-shard, multi-replica deployment for production

### Core Capabilities

- **Sharding**: Horizontal data distribution across multiple nodes
- **Replication**: Data redundancy within each shard
- **Parameter Tuning**: Dynamic configuration management
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana integration
- **TLS Support**: Secure communication between components


## Getting Started

To deploy ClickHouse with KubeBlocks:

```bash
# Install the ClickHouse addon
helm install clickhouse kubeblocks/clickhouse --version 1.0.1

# Create a cluster
helm install ch-cluster kubeblocks/clickhouse-cluster \
  --version 1.0.1-beta.0 \
  --set shards=3 \
  --set replicas=2
```
