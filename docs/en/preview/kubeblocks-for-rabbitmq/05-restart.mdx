## Restart

1. Execute the following command to restart the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: OpsRequest
   metadata:
     name: mycluster-restart
     namespace: demo
   spec:
     clusterName: mycluster
     type: Restart
     restart:
     - componentName: rabbitmq
   EOF
   ```

2. Check the Pod and operation status to verify the restart was successful:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pod -n demo

   kubectl get ops -n demo
   ```

   During the restart process, Pods will display the following two states:

   - STATUS=Terminating：Indicates the cluster is restarting
   - STATUS=Running：Indicates the cluster has completed restarting

   If any errors occur during the operation, use the kubectl describe ops -n demo command to view the operation's event logs for troubleshooting.
