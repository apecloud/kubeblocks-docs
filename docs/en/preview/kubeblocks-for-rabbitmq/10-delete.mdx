## Delete a cluster

### Termination policy

:::note

The termination policy determines how a cluster is deleted.

:::

| **terminationPolicy** | **Deleting Operation**                           |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `DoNotTerminate`      | `DoNotTerminate` prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.       |
| `Delete`              | `Delete` deletes Cluster resources like Pods, Services, and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.   |
| `WipeOut`             | `WipeOut` is an aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.  |

To check the termination policy, execute the following command.

```bash
kubectl get cluster mycluster -n demo
>
NAME        CLUSTER-DEFINITION    VERSION        TERMINATION-POLICY     STATUS    AGE
mycluster                                        Delete                 Running   55m
```

### Steps

Run the command below to delete a specified cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete -n demo cluster mycluster
```

If you want to delete a cluster and its all related resources, you can modify the termination policy to `WipeOut`, then delete the cluster.

```bash
kubectl patch -n demo cluster mycluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete -n demo cluster mycluster
```
