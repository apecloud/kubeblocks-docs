Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster rabbitmq-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
kubectl get cluster rabbitmq-cluster -n demo
NAME               CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
rabbitmq-cluster   rabbitmq             Delete               Creating   15s
rabbitmq-cluster   rabbitmq             Delete               Running    83s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=rabbitmq-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rabbitmq-cluster-rabbitmq-0   2/2     Running   0          106s
rabbitmq-cluster-rabbitmq-1   2/2     Running   0          82s
rabbitmq-cluster-rabbitmq-2   2/2     Running   0          47s
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your RabbitMQ cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
