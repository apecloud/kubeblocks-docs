# Upgrade to KubeBlocks v0.9.x

This guide walks you through upgrading KubeBlocks to version 0.9.x. The v0.9.x release series delivers significant improvements in performance, stability, and introduces powerful new features to enhance your database management experience.

## Before You Begin

### Verify Your Current Version

First, check which version of KubeBlocks you're currently running:

```bash
# Using helm
helm -n kb-system list | grep kubeblocks

# Using kbcli
kbcli version
```

### Choose Your Upgrade Path

Select the appropriate upgrade path based on your current version:

| Current Version | Target: v0.9.x | Upgrade Path |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| v0.9.x | ✅ Direct upgrade | Follow [Upgrade from KubeBlocks v0.9.x](#upgrade-from-kubeblocks-v09x) |
| v0.8.x | ✅ Direct upgrade | Follow [Upgrade from KubeBlocks v0.8.x](#upgrade-from-kubeblocks-v08x) |
| v0.7.x or earlier | ⚠️ Multi-step upgrade | Upgrade to v0.8.x first, then to v0.9.x |

:::tip
We recommend upgrading to the latest stable version for optimal performance and access to the newest features.

## Upgrade from KubeBlocks v0.9.x

This section covers upgrading between v0.9.x versions (for example, from v0.9.1 to v0.9.5). Since these are patch releases within the same major version, the upgrade process is straightforward.

:::note
**Version Placeholder:**

Throughout this section, replace `{VERSION}` with your target version number (e.g., `v0.9.5`, `v0.9.4`).
:::

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm" default>

  **Step 1: Update Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**

  KubeBlocks separates CRDs from the Helm chart to reduce chart size. Start by updating the CRDs:

  ```bash
  kubectl replace -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/{VERSION}/kubeblocks_crds.yaml
  ```

  **Step 2: Upgrade KubeBlocks Core**

  First, update your Helm repository to get the latest chart information:
  ```bash
  helm repo add kubeblocks https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
  helm repo update kubeblocks
  ```

  Then upgrade KubeBlocks to the target version:
  ```bash
  helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {VERSION} --set crd.enabled=false
  ```

  :::note
  **Why `crd.enabled=false`?**

  Since we're upgrading within the same v0.9.x series, no API conversion is needed. Setting `crd.enabled=false` skips the CRD upgrade task for faster deployment.
  :::

  **Step 3: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**

  :::warning
  **Addon Upgrade Impact:**

  Upgrading Addons may restart existing database clusters and affect availability. Only proceed during maintenance windows, or upgrade Addons individually as needed.
  :::

  To upgrade Addons to the versions bundled with the new KubeBlocks version:

  ```bash
  helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {VERSION} \
    --set upgradeAddons=true \
    --set crd.enabled=false
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli">

  **Step 1: Update kbcli**

  Download and install the matching version of kbcli:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh | bash -s {VERSION}
  ```

  **Step 2: Upgrade KubeBlocks Core**

  Perform the core upgrade without updating Addons:

  ```bash
  kbcli kb upgrade --version {VERSION}
  ```

  **Step 3: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**

  :::warning
  **Addon Upgrade Impact:**

  Upgrading Addons may restart existing database clusters and affect availability. Only proceed during maintenance windows, or upgrade Addons individually as needed.
  :::

  To upgrade Addons to the versions bundled with the new KubeBlocks version:

  ```bash
  kbcli kb upgrade --version {VERSION} --set upgradeAddons=true
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Upgrade from KubeBlocks v0.8.x

This section covers upgrading from v0.8.x to v0.9.x. This is a major version upgrade that requires additional preparation steps due to API changes.

:::note
**Key API Changes in v0.9.x:**

- Storage provider group updated from `storage.kubeblocks.io` to `dataprotection.kubeblocks.io`
- Enhanced ConfigConstraint API with multi-version support
:::

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm" default>

  **Step 1: Add the `"helm.sh/resource-policy": "keep"` annotation to Addons**

  KubeBlocks v0.9 changed the default installed Addons, so you need to add the `"helm.sh/resource-policy": "keep"` annotation to Addons to avoid deleting them during the upgrade.

  ```bash
  kubectl get addons -oname | xargs -I {} kubectl annotate {} helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
  ```

  **Step 2: Clean Up Incompatible Resources**

  Remove OpsDefinition that are incompatible with v0.9.x:

  ```bash
  # Delete specific incompatible OpsDefinitions
  kubectl delete opsdefinitions.apps.kubeblocks.io kafka-quota kafka-topic kafka-user-acl switchover

  # Alternative: Delete all OpsDefinitions (they will be recreated during upgrade)
  kubectl delete opsdefinitions.apps.kubeblocks.io --all
  ```

  **Step 3: Update Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**

  Install the new Storage Provider CRD required for v0.9.x and update all KubeBlocks CRDs to the new version:

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/{VERSION}/kubeblocks_crds.yaml || kubectl replace -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/{VERSION}/kubeblocks_crds.yaml
  ```

  :::note
  **Network Optimization:**

  Or download the CRD YAML files locally first, then apply them using `kubectl create -f <local-file-path> || kubectl replace -f <local-file-path>`.
  :::

  **Step 3: Update Helm Repository and Upgrade KubeBlocks**

  Update your Helm repository to get the latest chart information:

  ```bash
  helm repo add kubeblocks https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
  helm repo update kubeblocks
  ```

  Enable webhooks for multi-version conversion (it will convert ConfigConstraint API to the new version):

  ```bash
  helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {VERSION} \
    --set admissionWebhooks.enabled=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true
  ```

  :::note
  **Configuration Options Explained:**

  - `admissionWebhooks.enabled=true`: Enables webhook for ConfigConstraint API multi-version conversion
  - `admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true`: Allows webhook to run with single replica deployments
  :::

  **Step 4: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**

  :::warning
  **Addon Upgrade Impact:**

  Upgrading Addons may restart existing database clusters and affect availability. Only proceed during maintenance windows. Or you can upgrade Addons individually.
  :::

  ```bash
  helm -n kb-system upgrade kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --version {VERSION} \
    --set upgradeAddons=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.enabled=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli">

  **Step 1: Update kbcli**

  Download and install kbcli for the target version:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://kubeblocks.io/installer/install_cli.sh | bash -s {VERSION}
  ```

  Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  kbcli version
  ```

  **Step 2: Upgrade KubeBlocks with Webhook Support**

  Upgrade KubeBlocks with enhanced API validation and multi-version support:

  ```bash
  kbcli kb upgrade --version {VERSION} \
    --set admissionWebhooks.enabled=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true
  ```

  :::note
  **Configuration Options Explained:**

  - `admissionWebhooks.enabled=true`: Enables webhook for ConfigConstraint API multi-version conversion
  - `admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true`: Allows webhook to run with single replica deployments (useful for development environments)
  :::

  **Step 3: (Optional) Upgrade Addons**

  :::warning
  **Addon Upgrade Impact:**

  Upgrading Addons may restart existing database clusters and affect availability. Only proceed during maintenance windows, or upgrade Addons individually as needed.
  :::

  To upgrade Addons along with KubeBlocks:

  ```bash
  kbcli kb upgrade --version {VERSION} \
    --set upgradeAddons=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.enabled=true \
    --set admissionWebhooks.ignoreReplicasCheck=true
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Some Addons require special handling when upgrading from v0.8.x to v0.9.x.

- **Required**: The `mysql` Addon must be upgraded when moving from v0.8.x to v0.9.x. Clusters created in v0.8.x will not function properly in v0.9.x without this upgrade.
- **Recommended**: For `clickhouse`, `milvus`, `elasticsearch`, and `llm` Addons, upgrade KubeBlocks first, then upgrade these Addons for optimal functionality.

## Individual Addon Upgrades

If you chose not to upgrade Addons during the KubeBlocks upgrade, or if you need to upgrade specific Addons, follow these steps to upgrade Addons individually.

### Upgrade Methods

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm" default>

  **Step 1: Configure Addon Repository**

  ```bash
  # Add the primary Addon repository
  helm repo add kubeblocks-addons https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts

  # Alternative repository for users in regions with limited GitHub access
  # helm repo add kubeblocks-addons https://jihulab.com/api/v4/projects/150246/packages/helm/stable

  # Update repository information
  helm repo update
  ```

  **Step 2: Find Available Versions**

  ```bash
  # Search for available versions of a specific Addon
  helm search repo kubeblocks-addons/{addon-name} --versions --devel
  # Example: helm search repo kubeblocks-addons/mysql --versions --devel
  ```

  **Step 3: Upgrade the Addon**

  Select a version that is compatible (same major version) with your KubeBlocks release and upgrade:

  ```bash
  # Upgrade to a specific version
  helm upgrade -i {addon-release-name} kubeblocks-addons/{addon-name} --version x.y.z -n kb-system
  ```

  :::note
  **Parameter Reference:**
  - `{addon-name}`: Replace with the actual Addon name (e.g., `mysql`, `postgresql`)
  - `{addon-release-name}`: The release name of the installed Addon (e.g., `kb-addon-mysql`, `kb-addon-postgresql`)
  - `x.y.z`: The target version number, compatible with your KubeBlocks release
  :::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kbcli" label="kbcli">

  **Step 1: Update Addon Index**

  ```bash
  # List available Addon indexes (the default index is `kubeblocks`)
  kbcli addon index list

  # Update the default KubeBlocks index
  kbcli addon index update kubeblocks
  ```

  **Step 2: Search for Available Addon Versions**

  ```bash
  # Search for available versions of a specific Addon
  kbcli addon search {addon-name}

  # View currently installed Addons and their versions
  kbcli addon list | grep {addon-name}
  ```

  **Step 3: Upgrade the Addon**

  Select a version that is compatible (same major version) with your KubeBlocks release and upgrade:

  ```bash
  kbcli addon upgrade {addon-name} --version x.y.z
  ```

  **Force upgrade (use with caution):**
  ```bash
  kbcli addon upgrade {addon-name} --version x.y.z --force
  ```

  **Fresh installation (if not previously installed):**
  ```bash
  kbcli addon install {addon-name} --version x.y.z
  ```

  :::note
  **When to use `--force`:**
  - You need to downgrade to a previous version
  - Use with caution as it bypasses compatibility checks
