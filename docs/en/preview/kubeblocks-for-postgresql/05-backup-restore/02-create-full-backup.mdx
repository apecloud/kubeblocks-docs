# Create a Full Backup for PostgreSQL on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to create and validate full backups for PostgreSQL clusters on KubeBlocks using the `pg-basebackup` method through both:
- The Backup API (direct backup operations)
- The OpsRequest API (managed backup operations with enhanced monitoring)

We will cover how to restore data from a backup in the [Restore From Full Backup](./05-restoring-from-full-backup) guide.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

import CreatePGCluster from '../_tpl/_create-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreatePGCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyPGCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-pg-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyPGCluster />

## Backup Prerequisites

Before creating backups, ensure:
1. Backup repository is configured:
   - `BackupRepo` resource exists
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repository
   - `BackupRepo` status shows "Ready"

2. Cluster is ready:
   - Cluster status is "Running"
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades, etc.)

## Identify Backup Configuration

Check available backup policies and schedules:

```bash
# List backup policies
kubectl get backuppolicy -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster

# List backup schedules
kubectl get backupschedule -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                                            BACKUP-REPO   STATUS      AGE
pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy                           Available   58m

NAME                                              STATUS      AGE
pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule             Available   60m
```

View supported backup methods in the BackupPolicy CR 'pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy':

```bash
kubectl get backuppolicy pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec.backupMethods[].name'
```

Example Output:
```bash
pg-basebackup
wal-g
wal-g-incremental
archive-wal
wal-g-archive
```


**List of Backup methods**

KubeBlocks PostgreSQL supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Full Backup       | pg-basebackup   | Uses `pg_basebackup`, a PostgreSQL utility to create a base backup |
| Full Backup       | wal-g  | Uses `wal-g` to create a full backup (requires WAL-G configuration) |
| Continuous Backup | postgresql-pitr | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `pg-basebackup`|
| Continuous Backup | wal-g-archive | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `wal-g`|

## Backup via Backup API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

The `pg-basebackup` method uses PostgreSQL's native `pg_basebackup` utility.

Apply this manifest to create a backup:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster-pg-basebackup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backupMethod: pg-basebackup
  backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
  # Determines whether the backup contents stored in the backup repository should be deleted
  # when the backup custom resource(CR) is deleted. Supported values are `Retain` and `Delete`.
  # - `Retain` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are kept.
  # - `Delete` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are deleted.
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### 2. Monitor Backup and Verify Completion

Track progress until status shows "Completed":

```bash
kubectl get backup pg-cluster-pg-basebackup  -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME                       POLICY                                METHOD          REPO            STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
pg-cluster-pg-basebackup   pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy   pg-basebackup   <BACKUP_REPO>   Completed   4722262      10s        Delete            2025-05-16T02:53:45Z   2025-05-16T02:53:55Z
```

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Check files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Backup file size


## Backup via OpsRequest API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

Execute a backup using the OpsRequest API with the 'pg-basebackup' method:

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: pg-cluster
  force: false
  backup:
    backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
    backupMethod: pg-basebackup
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    retentionPeriod: 1mo
  type: Backup
```

### 2. Monitor Backup Progress

#### 1. Monitor Operation Status

Track backup progress in real-time:
```bash
kubectl get ops pg-cluster-backup  -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                TYPE     CLUSTER      STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
pg-cluster-backup   Backup   pg-cluster   Succeed   -/-        35s
```

- A STATUS of 'Succeed' indicates the backup operation completed successfully.

#### 2. Verify Completion

Check the final backup status:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l operations.kubeblocks.io/ops-name=pg-cluster-backup
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                                    POLICY                                METHOD          REPO           STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
backup-demo-pg-cluster-20250516025810   pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy   pg-basebackup   <BACKUP_REPO>  Completed   4725590      10s        Delete            2025-05-16T02:58:10Z   2025-05-16T02:58:20Z   2025-06-15T02:58:20Z
```
- The backup status should show 'Completed'.

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Other metadata

## Troubleshooting

When encountering backup issues, such as Backup status is `Failed`  or stucks in `Running`for quite a long time, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the problem:

1. Inspect the Backup resource for any error events or status updates:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe backup <BACKUP_NAME> -n demo
  ```

2. Verify the backup job status and examine its logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get job -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster,app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=kubeblocks-dataprotection
  ```
  And check pod logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo logs <POD_NAME>
  ```
3. Review KubeBlocks controller logs for detailed error information:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kb-system logs deploy/kubeblocks -f
  ```

## Summary

1. Deploying a replication PostgreSQL cluster
2. Creating full backups using:
