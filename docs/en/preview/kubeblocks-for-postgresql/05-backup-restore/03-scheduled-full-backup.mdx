# Setting Up a PostgreSQL Cluster with Scheduled Backups in KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster using KubeBlocks and configure scheduled backups with retention in an S3 repository.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - KubeBlocks CLI and KubeBlocks Operator are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## List of Backup methods

KubeBlocks PostgreSQL supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Full Backup       | pg-basebackup   | Uses `pg_basebackup`, a PostgreSQL utility to create a base backup |
| Full Backup       | wal-g  | Uses `wal-g` to create a full backup (requires WAL-G configuration) |
| Continuous Backup | postgresql-pitr | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `pg-basebackup`|
| Continuous Backup | wal-g-archive | Uploads PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files periodically to the backup repository, usually paired with `wal-g`|

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

Deploy a 2-node semi-sync PostgreSQL cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: postgresql
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: postgresql
      serviceVersion: 16.4.0
      labels:
        apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
      disableExporter: true
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
$ kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output::

```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Creating   50s
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Running    4m2s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your PostgreSQL cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.

## Prerequisites for Backup

1. Backup Repository Configured:
   - Configured `BackupRepo`
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repo, `BackupRepo` status is `Ready`

2. Cluster is Running:
   - Cluster must be in `Running` state
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades etc.)

## Configure Scheduled Backups

KubeBlocks automatically creates a `BackupSchedule` resource when the cluster is created. Follow these steps to enable and configure scheduled backups:

1. Verify the default backup schedule configuration:

```bash
$ kubectl get backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule  -n demo -oyaml
```

Expected Output:
```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupSchedule
spec:
  backupPolicyName: pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-policy
  schedules:
  - backupMethod: pg-basebackup
    # ┌───────────── minute (0-59)
    # │ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
    # │ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
    # │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
    # │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6) (Sunday=0)
    # │ │ │ │ │
    # 0 18 * * *
    # schedule this job every day at 6:00 PM (18:00).
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * * # update the cronExpression to your need
    enabled: false # set to `true` to schedule base backup periodically
    retentionPeriod: 7d # set the retention period to your need
```

2. Enable and customize the backup schedule:
```bash
kubectl edit backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule -n demo
```

Update these key parameters:
- `enabled`: Set to `true` to activate scheduled backups
- `cronExpression`: Configure backup frequency using cron syntax
- `retentionPeriod`: Set how long to keep backups (e.g., `7d`, `1mo`)

Example configuration for daily backups at 6PM UTC with 7-day retention:
```yaml
schedules:
- backupMethod: pg-basebackup
  enabled: true
  cronExpression: "0 18 * * *"
  retentionPeriod: 7d
```

3. Verify the schedule configuration:
```bash
# Check schedule status
kubectl get backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule -n demo -w

# View detailed configuration
kubectl describe backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule -n demo
```

## Monitoring and Managing Backups

After enabling scheduled backups, monitor their execution and manage backup retention:

1. View all backups:
```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster
```

2. Inspect backup details:
```bash
kubectl describe backup <backup-name> -n demo
```

3. Verify backup artifacts:
- Status should show "Completed"
- Check backup size matches expectations
- Confirm retention period is being applied
- Validate backup files exist in repository

4. Manage backup retention:
- To manually delete old backups:
```bash
kubectl delete backup <backup-name> -n demo
```
- To modify retention period:
```bash
kubectl edit backupschedule pg-cluster-postgresql-backup-schedule -n demo
```

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the PostgreSQL cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster pg-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary

This guide demonstrated:
1. Configuration of automated PostgreSQL backups
2. Schedule customization using cron syntax
3. Retention policy management
4. Backup verification procedures

Your PostgreSQL cluster now has:
- Regular automated backups
- Configurable retention policies
- Complete backup history tracking
