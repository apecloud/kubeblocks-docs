# Upgrading the Minor Version of a PostgreSQL Cluster in KubeBlocks

This guide walks you through the deployment and minor version upgrade of a PostgreSQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks, ensuring minimal downtime during the process.

To minimize the impact on database availability, the upgrade process starts with the replicas (secondary instances). Once the replicas are upgraded, a switchover operation promotes one of the upgraded replicas to primary. The switchover process is very fast, typically completing in a few hundred milliseconds. After the switchover, the original primary instance is upgraded, ensuring minimal disruption to the application.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Replication Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing PostgreSQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a PostgreSQL cluster with 2 replicas (1 primary, 1 replicas).

Apply the following YAML configuration to deploy the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: postgresql
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: postgresql
      serviceVersion: 14.7.2  # use 14.7.2 here to test minor version upgrade
      labels:
        apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
      disableExporter: true
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

## Verifying the Deployment
Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Creating   50s
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Running    4m2s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your PostgreSQL cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.

## List All Available PostgreSQL Versions

Use the following command to display the PostgreSQL versions supported by your KubeBlocks installation:
```bash
kubectl get cmpv postgresql
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME         VERSIONS                                              STATUS      AGE
postgresql   16.4.0,15.7.0,14.8.0,14.7.2,12.15.0,12.14.1,12.14.0   Available   33d
```

Note: The list of supported versions may vary depending on your KubeBlocks version.

## Upgrading the PostgreSQL Version

### Identify the Current Primary and Secondary Instances

Run the following command to identify the roles of the cluster instances:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster -L kubeblocks.io/role
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   ROLE
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   0          66m   primary
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   4/4     Running   0          65m   secondary
```

### Check compatible versions for the same ComponentDefinition

**Step 1.** Get the list of `ComponentDefinition` associated with a given `ComponentVersion`

```bash
kubectl get cmpv postgresql -ojson | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."componentversion.kubeblocks.io/compatible-definitions"' | tr ',' '\n'
```

<details>
<summary>Example Output</summary>
```text
postgresql-12-1.0.0
postgresql-14-1.0.0
postgresql-15-1.0.0
postgresql-16-1.0.0
```
</details>

**Step 2.** Get the list of ComponentDefinition associated with a given ComponentVersion

```bash
kubectl get cmpv postgresql -o json | jq -r '.spec.compatibilityRules[] | select(.compDefs | any(startswith("postgresql-14"))) | .releases[]'
```

This returns versions compatible with `ComponentDefinition` named `postgresql-14`:

<details open>
<summary>Example Output</summary>
```text
14.7.2
14.8.0
```
</details>

### Apply the Upgrade

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Secondary replicas are upgrade first (one at a time)
1. Primary is upgrade last after secondary replicas are healthy
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

To upgrade the PostgreSQL version, modify the serviceVersion field in the Cluster resource. In this example, we will upgrade the PostgreSQL version from `14.7.2` to `14.8.0`

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="opsRequest" label="OpsRequest API" default>

  Option 1: Using OpsRequest

  You can upgrade the cluster using an OpsRequest:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: pg-upgrade
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
    clusterName: pg-cluster
    type: Upgrade
    upgrade:
      components:
      - componentName: postgresql
        # Specifies the desired service version of component
        serviceVersion: "14.8.0"
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ClusterAPI" label="Cluster API">
  Option 1: Using the Declarative Cluster API

  Alternatively, you may stop the cluster by setting the `spec.componentSpecs.serviceVersion` field in the cluster configuration:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  metadata:
    name: pg-cluster
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    terminationPolicy: Delete
    clusterDef: postgresql
    topology: replication
    componentSpecs:
      - name: postgresql
        serviceVersion: 14.8.0  # set to 14.8.0 for upgrading
        labels:
          apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
        disableExporter: true
        replicas: 2
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "0.5Gi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "0.5Gi"
        volumeClaimTemplates:
          - name: data
            spec:
              accessModes:
                - ReadWriteOnce
              resources:
                requests:
                  storage: 20Gi
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Monitor the Upgrade Process
During the upgrade, observe the changes in the cluster's Pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   0          97s
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   4/4     Running   0          50s
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   3/4     Running   2 (2s ago)   68s
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   2 (6s ago)   2m6s
```
**Key Observations:**
- The secondary replica ('pg-cluster-postgresql-1') is upgraded first.
- A switchover operation occurs, making the replica the new primary.
- Finally, the original primary ('pg-cluster-postgresql-0') is upgraded.

After the upgrade is completed, roles are switched:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=pg-cluster -L kubeblocks.io/role
```
Updated Roles:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   ROLE
pg-cluster-postgresql-0   4/4     Running   0          2m    secondary
pg-cluster-postgresql-1   4/4     Running   0          2m    primary
```

## Verification

### Check Cluster Status
Ensure the cluster is in the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql                Delete               Running   17m
```

### Verify the PostgreSQL Version
Retrieve the PostgreSQL postgres credentials:
```bash
NAME=`kubectl get secrets -n demo pg-cluster-postgresql-account-postgres -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d`
PASSWD=`kubectl get secrets -n demo pg-cluster-postgresql-account-postgres -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d`
```

Connect to the upgraded instances and verify the PostgreSQL version:
```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n demo pg-cluster-postgresql-1 -- \
  env PGUSER=${NAME} PGPASSWORD=${PASSWD} psql -c "SELECT VERSION();"
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
- Deploy a PostgreSQL replication cluster using KubeBlocks.
- Perform a rolling upgrade of the PostgreSQL minor version with minimal downtime.
- Verify that the upgrade was successful.
This rolling upgrade strategy ensures high availability by upgrading the replicas first, performing a switchover, and then upgrading the original primary instance.
