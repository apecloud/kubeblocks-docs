# PostgreSQL Vertical Scaling

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a PostgreSQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

## Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU/memory) for PostgreSQL instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks orchestrates scaling with minimal impact:
1. Secondary replicas update first
2. Primary updates last after secondaries are healthy
3. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - KubeBlocks CLI and KubeBlocks Operator are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a PostgreSQL Cluster

Deploy a 2-node semi-sync PostgreSQL cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: pg-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: postgresql
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: postgresql
      serviceVersion: 16.4.0
      labels:
        apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
      disableExporter: true
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
$ kubectl get cluster pg-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output::

```bash
NAME         CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Creating   50s
pg-cluster   postgresql           Delete               Running    4m2s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your PostgreSQL cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Secondary replicas are updated first (one at a time)
1. Primary is updated last after secondary replicas are healthy
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the postgresql component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: pg-cluster-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: pg-cluster
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: postgresql
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```
  What Happens During Vertical Scaling?
  - Secondary Pods are recreated first to ensure the primary Pod remains available.
  - Once all secondary Pods are updated, the primary Pod is restarted with the new resource configuration.


  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops pg-cluster-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                    TYPE              CLUSTER      STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   0/2        52s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   1/2        64s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   2/2        2m6s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Running   2/2        2m6s
  pg-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   pg-cluster   Succeed   2/2        2m6s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: pg-cluster
      namespace: demo
    spec:
      terminationPolicy: Delete
      clusterDef: postgresql
      topology: replication
      componentSpecs:
        - name: postgresql
          serviceVersion: 16.4.0
          labels:
            apps.kubeblocks.postgres.patroni/scope: pg-cluster-postgresql
          disableExporter: true
          replicas: 2
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
              memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
            limits:
              cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
              memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          volumeClaimTemplates:
            - name: data
              spec:
                storageClassName: ""
                accessModes:
                  - ReadWriteOnce
                resources:
                  requests:
                    storage: 20Gi
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU:Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting PostgreSQL parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
$ kbcli cluster describe pg-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT    INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
postgresql                       1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      standard
```

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the postgresql component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your PostgreSQL cluster remains performant and resilient.
