KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing Kafka  Clusters.
Below is an example configuration for deploying a Kafka Cluster with 3 components

Apply the following YAML configuration to deploy the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: kafka-separated-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: kafka
  topology: separated_monitor
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-broker
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      env:
        - name: KB_KAFKA_BROKER_HEAP
          value: "-XshowSettings:vm -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=100 -Ddepth=64"
        - name: KB_KAFKA_CONTROLLER_HEAP
          value: "-XshowSettings:vm -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=100 -Ddepth=64"
        - name: KB_BROKER_DIRECT_POD_ACCESS
          value: "true"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
        - name: metadata
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi
    - name: kafka-controller
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: metadata
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi
    - name: kafka-exporter
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "1Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.1"
          memory: "0.2Gi"
```


:::note

These three components will be created strictly in `controller->broker->exporter` order as defined in `ClusterDefinition`.
