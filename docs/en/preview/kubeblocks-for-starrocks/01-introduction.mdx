# StarRocks

StarRocks is a Linux Foundation project, it is the next-generation data platform designed to make data-intensive real-time analytics fast and easy.

StarRocks supports **shared-nothing** (Each BE has a portion of the data on its local storage) and **shared-data** (all data on object storage or HDFS and each CN has only cache on local storage).

- FrontEnds (FE) are responsible for metadata management, client connection management, query planning, and query scheduling. Each FE stores and maintains a complete copy of the metadata in its memory, which guarantees indiscriminate services among the FEs.
- BackEnds (BE) are responsible for data storage, data processing, and query execution. Each BE stores a portion of the data and processes the queries in parallel.

KubeBlocks supports creating a **shared-nothing** StarRocks cluster.
