# Create Redis Cluster With Custom Password on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Redis cluster in KubeBlocks with a custom root password stored in a Kubernetes Secret.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploying the Redis Replication Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing Redis clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a Redis cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) and a custom root password.

### Step 1: Create a Secret for the Defaults Account

The custom root password is stored in a Kubernetes Secret. Create the Secret by applying the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: Y3VzdG9tcGFzc3dvcmQ= # custompassword
  username: cm9vdA== #root
immutable: true
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-secret
  namespace: demo
```
- password: Replace custompassword with your desired password and encode it using Base64 (`echo -n "custompassword" | base64`).
- username: The default Redis default user is 'default', encoded as 'cm9vdA=='.


### Step 2: Deploy the Redis Cluster

Apply the following manifest to deploy the Redis cluster, referencing the Secret created in Step 1 for the root account:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: redis-replication
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: redis
  topology: replication
  componentSpecs:
    - name: redis
      serviceVersion: "7.2.4"
      disableExporter: false
      replicas: 2
      systemAccounts:  # override systemaccount password
        - name: default
          secretRef:
            name: custom-secret
            namespace: demo
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
    - name: redis-sentinel
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```
**Explanation of Key Fields**
- `systemAccounts`: overrides system accounts defined in referenced ComponentDefinition.

:::tip

In KubeBlocks Redis Addon, a list of system accounts are defined. And only those accounts can be `customized` with a new secret.

:::

To get the of of accounts:
```bash
kubectl get cmpd redis-7-1.0.0-alpha.0 -oyaml | yq '.spec.systemAccounts[].name'
```

Example Output:
```bash
default
```

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Connecting to the Redis Cluster

KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the Redis root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo redis-replication-redis-account-default -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
custompassword
```

To connect to the cluster's primary node, use the Redis client with the custom password:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo redis-replication-redis-0 -c redis -- reids-cli -a ${PASSWD}
```

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Redis cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster redis-replication -n demo
kubectl delete secret custom-secret -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you:
- Created a Kubernetes Secret to securely store a custom Redis default password.
- Deployed a Redis cluster in KubeBlocks with a custom root password.
- Verified the deployment and connected to the cluster's primary node using the Redis client.

Using Kubernetes Secrets ensures secure credential management for your Redis clusters, while KubeBlocks simplifies the deployment and management process.
