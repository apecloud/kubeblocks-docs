Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster redis-replication -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
NAME                CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
redis-replication   redis                Delete               Running   3m49s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication -L  kubeblocks.io/role -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
redis-replication-redis-0            3/3     Running   0          3m38s   primary
redis-replication-redis-1            3/3     Running   0          3m16s   secondary
redis-replication-redis-sentinel-0   2/2     Running   0          4m35s
redis-replication-redis-sentinel-1   2/2     Running   0          4m17s
redis-replication-redis-sentinel-2   2/2     Running   0          3m59s
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your Redis cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
