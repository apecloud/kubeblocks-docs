# Setting Up a Redis Cluster with Scheduled Continuous Backup Enabled in KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to configure a Redis cluster on KubeBlocks with:

- Scheduled full backups (base backups)
- Continuous WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving
- Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities

This combination provides comprehensive data protection with minimal recovery point objectives (RPO).

## What is PITR?
Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) allows you to restore a database to a specific moment in time by combining full backups with continuous binlog/wal/archive log backups.

For details on restoring data from both full backups and continuous binlog backups, refer to the [Restore From PITR](restore-with-pitr.mdx)  guide.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - KubeBlocks CLI and KubeBlocks Operator are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Prerequisites for Backup

1. Backup Repository Configured:
   - Configured `BackupRepo`
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repo, `BackupRepo` status is `Ready`

2. Cluster is Running:
   - Cluster must be in `Running` state
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades etc.)

## List of Backup methods

KubeBlocks Redis supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | datafile  | uses `redis-cli BGSAVE` command to backup data |
| Continuous Backup | aof | continuously perform incremental backups by archiving Append-Only Files (AOF) |

## Deploy a Redis Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-redis-replication-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Enable Continuous Backup

### Preparation: set `aof-timestamp-enabled` to `yes`
Redis Append Only Files(AOFs) record every write operation received by the server, in the order they were processed, which allows Redis to reconstruct the dataset by replaying these commands.
KubeBlocks supports continuous backup for the Redis component by archiving Append-Only Files (AOF). It will process incremental AOF files, update base AOF file, purge expired files and save backup status (records metadata about the backup process, such as total size and timestamps, to the `Backup` resource).

Before enabling a continuous backup, you must set variable `aof-timestamp-enabled` to `yes`.

```yaml
# cat examples/redis/reconfigure-aof.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: redis-reconfigure-aof
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: redis-replication
  reconfigures:
  - componentName: redis
    parameters:
      # Represents the name of the parameter that is to be updated.
    - key: aof-timestamp-enabled
      value: 'yes'
  type: Reconfiguring
```

:::note
Once `aof-timestamp-enabled` is on, Redis will include timestamp in the AOF file.
It may have following side effects: storage overhead, performance overhead (write latency).
It is not recommended to enable this feature when you have high write throughput, or you have limited storage space.

### Update BackupSchedule

Update `BackupSchedule` to schedule enable(`enabled`) backup methods and set the time (`cronExpression`) to your need:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupSchedule
spec:
  backupPolicyName: redis-replication-redis-backup-policy
  schedules:
  - backupMethod: datafile
    # ┌───────────── minute (0-59)
    # │ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
    # │ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
    # │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
    # │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6) (Sunday=0)
    # │ │ │ │ │
    # 0 18 * * *
    # schedule this job every day at 6:00 PM (18:00).
    cronExpression: 0 18 * * * # update the cronExpression to your need
    enabled: true # set to `true` to schedule base backup periodically
    retentionPeriod: 7d # set the retention period to your need
  - backupMethod: aof
    cronExpression: '*/30 * * * *'
    enabled: true   # set to `true` to enable continuous backup
    name: aof
    retentionPeriod: 8d # by default, retentionPeriod of continuous backup is 1d more than that of a full backup.
```

1. **Full Backups** (datafile):
  - Use redis `BGSAVE` command to perform a full backup
  - Runs on configured schedule (daily by default)
  - Serves as base for PITR

2. **Continuous Backups** (archive-oplog):
  - Continuously processing incremental AOF files, update base AOF file, purge expired files
  - Maintains backup metadata including size and time ranges

## Monitoring Continuous Backups

Verify continuous backup operation with these commands:
```bash
# get continuous backup
kubectl get backup -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
# get pod working for continuous backup
kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=redis-replication,dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Continuous -n demo
```

## Summary

This guide covered:
1. Configuring scheduled full backups with pg-basebackup
2. Enabling continuous WAL archiving with wal-g-archive
3. Setting up Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities
4. Monitoring backup operations

Key Benefits:
- Scheduled full backups ensure regular recovery points
- Continuous WAL archiving minimizes potential data loss
- PITR enables recovery to any moment in time
