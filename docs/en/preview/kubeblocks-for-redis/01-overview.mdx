# Overview of KubeBlocks Redis Addon

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. This example shows how it can be managed in Kubernetes with KubeBlocks.


## Key Features

### Supported Topologies

| Topology      | Data Distribution | Scalability | High Availability | Use Cases                     |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Standalone**| Single node       | No          | No                 | Development/testing, small datasets |
| **Replication** with sentinel     | Primary-Secondary replication | Read scaling | Yes | Read-heavy workloads, data redundancy needed |
| **Cluster**   | Sharded storage   | Read/write scaling | Yes | Large datasets, high-concurrency production environments |

### Lifecycle Management

KubeBlocks simplifies Redis operations with comprehensive lifecycle management:

| Feature                      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scaling**       | Scale replicas in/out to adjust capacity                                   |
| **Vertical Scaling**         | Adjust CPU/memory resources for Redis instances                       |
| **Volume Expansion**         | Dynamically increase storage capacity without downtime                     |
| **Restart Operations**       | Controlled cluster restarts with minimal disruption                        |
| **Start/Stop**               | Temporarily suspend/resume cluster operations                              |
| **Password Management**      | Ability to set and manage custom root password for the Redis cluster during creation |
| **Dynamic Configuration**    | Modify Redis parameters without restarting                            |
| **Custom Services**          | Expose specialized database endpoints                                      |
| **Switchover**               | Planned primary-replica role changes                                       |
| **Replica Management**       | Safely decommission or rebuild specific replicas                          |
| **Version Upgrades**         | Perform minor version upgrades seamlessly                                  |
| **Advanced Scheduling**      | Customize pod placement and resource allocation                           |
| **Monitoring**               | Integrated Prometheus metrics collection                                  |
| **Logging**                  | Centralized logs via Loki Stack                                           |


### Backup and Restore

KubeBlocks supports multiple backup strategies for Redis:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | datafile  | Uses `redis-cli BGSAVE` command to backup data |
| Continuous Backup | aof | Continuously perform incremental backups by archiving Append-Only Files (AOF) |
