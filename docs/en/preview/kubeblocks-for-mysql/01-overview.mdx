# Overview of KubeBlocks MySQL Addon

The **KubeBlocks MySQL Addon** offers a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing MySQL clusters in Kubernetes. This document provides an overview of its features, including deployment topologies, lifecycle management options, backup and restore functionality, and supported MySQL versions.

## Features

### Topologies
The **KubeBlocks Operator** supports deploying MySQL in three different topologies, tailored to meet varying requirements for performance, consistency, and high availability:


| Features                      | Description
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SemiSync                      | Leverages MySQL’s semi-synchronous replication mechanism to achieve near-real-time data consistency. <br /> • Requires at least one replica to acknowledge receipt of the transaction before the primary commits. <br /> • Balances performance and consistency by reducing the chance of data loss in case of a primary failure.                                                    |
| MySQL Group Replication (MGR) | Creates a distributed, multi-primary MySQL cluster using MySQL’s native Group Replication. <br /> • Ensures fault-tolerant operations and automatic data synchronization across all nodes. <br /> • Provides built-in conflict detection and resolution for continuous database availability.                  |
| Orchestrator Integration      | Integrates an external Orchestrator for high-availability (HA) management. <br /> • Adds automated monitoring and failover capabilities, including replica promotion. <br /> • Allows dynamic handling of node failures or degradations, reducing downtime. |

With these options, you can tailor your MySQL deployment to your specific requirements for performance, consistency, and availability.

### Lifecycle Management

KubeBlocks provides robust lifecycle management features to simplify MySQL cluster operations:

| Horizontal scaling            | Modifying the number of replicas will trigger scale-in and scale-out operations                                         |
| Vertical scaling              | Ability to adjust compute resources (CPU and memory) for MySQL replicas                                                 |
