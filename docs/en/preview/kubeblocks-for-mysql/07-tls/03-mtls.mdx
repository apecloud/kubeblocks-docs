# Create a MySQL Cluster With mTLS on KubeBlocks

This guide explains how to configure a MySQL cluster with **mutual TLS (mTLS)** encryption using KubeBlocks. mTLS ensures both the server and client authenticate each other during a connection, providing enhanced security for your database infrastructure. This guide covers certificate generation, cluster deployment, user configuration for mTLS, and secure connection verification.


## What is mTLS?
Mutual TLS (mTLS) is an enhanced security protocol that ensures both the server and the client authenticate each other during a connection. Unlike traditional TLS, where only the client verifies the server's identity, mTLS adds an extra layer of security by requiring both sides to present valid certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Generating Certificates

To enable TLS encryption, you will need to provide a Certificate Authority (CA), a server certificate, and a private key. Follow these steps to generate these using OpenSSL:

1. Generate the Root Certificate (CA)
```bash
# Create the CA private key (password optional)
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca-key.pem 4096

# Generate a self-signed root certificate (valid for 10 years)
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca.pem
# Enter the required information (e.g., Common Name can be "MySQL Root CA")
```

2. Generate the Server Certificate & Key
```bash
# Generate the server private key
openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 4096

# Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
# Enter server identification details, such as:
# Common Name (CN) = Server domain name or IP (must match the MySQL server address!)

# Sign the server certificate with the CA (valid for 10 years)
openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 3650 -sha256
```

3. Generate the Client Certificate & Key
```bash
# Generate the client private key
openssl genrsa -out client-key.pem 4096

# Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out client-req.pem
# Enter client identification details, such as:
# Common Name (CN) = Client username (e.g., "mysql_client_1")

# Sign the client certificate with the CA (valid for 1 year)
openssl x509 -req -in client-req.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client-cert.pem -days 365 -sha256
```

4. Verify the Certificates
Verify that the server certificate is valid and signed by the CA:
```bash
# Verify the server certificate
openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server-cert.pem
```
Example Output:
```bash
server-cert.pem: OK
```

```bash
# Verify the client certificate
openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem client-cert.pem
```
Example Output:
```bash
client-cert.pem: OK
```

## Create Kubernetes Secrets
Store the generated certificates and keys in a Kubernetes Secret to make them accessible to your MySQL cluster.
```bash
kubectl create secret generic mysql-tls-secret \
  --namespace=demo \
  --from-file=ca.crt=ca.pem \
  --from-file=tls.crt=server-cert.pem \
  --from-file=tls.key=server-key.pem \
  --type=kubernetes.io/tls
```
This secret contains the CA, server certificate, and private key required to enable mTLS on the MySQL cluster.

## Deploying the MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MySQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MySQL cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) in semi-synchronous mode with user-provided TLS certificates:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      tls: true
      issuer:
        name: UserProvided
        secretRef:
          name: mysql-tls-secret
          namespace: demo
          ca: ca.crt
          cert: tls.crt
          key: tls.key
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

## Verifying the Deployment

Check cluster status until it reaches Running state:

```bash
kubectl get cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   11m
```

## Configure an mTLS User in MySQL

### Retrieve MySQL Root Credentials

KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the MySQL root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:

1. Retrieve the root username:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
```
Example Output:
```bash
root
```

2. Retrieve the root password:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
Example Output:
```bash
D0o5P43S8G
```

### Connect Using the Root Account

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -pD0o5P43S8G
```

### Create an mTLS User

Run the following commands in the MySQL shell to create a user that requires client certificate authentication:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'mtls_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'kni676X2W1' REQUIRE X509;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mtls_user'@'%';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

## Connect to MySQL Cluster with mTLS

use the `kubectl port-forward` command to map port 3306 of the primary replica of the MySQL Cluster to port 3306 on your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/mysql-cluster-mysql 3306:3306 -n default
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3306 -> 3306
Forwarding from [::1]:3306 -> 3306
```

Then, open another shell and use the mysql command-line tool to connect to the local port 3306.

If connecting without client certificates, you will see an error:
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -umtls_user -pkni676X2W1 --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
```
Example Output:
```bash
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'mtls_user'@'127.0.0.1' (using password: YES)
```

To connect successfully, provide the client certificate and key:
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -umtls_user -pkni676X2W1 --ssl-mode=REQUIRED --ssl-ca=/path/to/ca.pem --ssl-cert=/path/to/client-cert.pem --ssl-key=/path/to/client-key.pem
```

Verify TLS connection status in MySQL shell:
```sql
mysql> STATUS;
--------------

SSL:			Cipher in use is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

## Cleanup
Remove all resources created during this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete secret mysql-tls-secret -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```
