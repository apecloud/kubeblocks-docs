# Deploying a MySQL Cluster with TLS on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a MySQL cluster with **TLS encryption** using KubeBlocks. TLS ensures secure communication between the MySQL client and server by encrypting data in transit, protecting sensitive information. You will learn how to deploy the cluster, connect securely using TLS, and clean up resources after testing.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploying the MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MySQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MySQL cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) in semi-synchronous mode with TLS enabled.

Apply the following YAML configuration:
```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      tls: true
      issuer:
        name: KubeBlocks
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```
### Explanation:
- `tls: true`: Enables TLS encryption for secure communication.
- `issuer: KubeBlocks`: Uses KubeBlocks' default built-in certificate issuer for TLS.

## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   11m
```

## Connect to MySQL Cluster

### Step 1: Retrieve the Root Credentials
KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the MySQL root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:

1. Retrieve the root username:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
```
Example Output:
```bash
root
```

2. Retrieve the root password:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
Example Output:
```bash
43Rysk6w10
```

### Step 2: Connect to MySQL Securely Using TLS
Use the MySQL client to connect securely with TLS enabled. The '--ssl-mode=REQUIRED' option enforces the use of TLS for encryption.
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -p43Rysk6w10 --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
```

### Step 3: Verify the TLS Connection
Verify TLS connection status in MySQL shell:
```sql
mysql> STATUS;
--------------

SSL:			Cipher in use is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```
If the SSL field displays a cipher, the connection is successfully encrypted using TLS.

## Cleanup
To remove all resources created in this tutorial, run the following commands:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
- Deploy a MySQL cluster using KubeBlocks and enable TLS encryption for secure communication between the MySQL client and server.
- Establish a secure MySQL connection with TLS.
- Verify the secure connection using the MySQL shell.

TLS encryption ensures secure communication by encrypting data in transit and protecting sensitive information. By following these steps, you can deploy a secure MySQL cluster on Kubernetes with ease using KubeBlocks.
