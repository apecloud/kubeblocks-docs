# Set Instance Update Strategy to OnDelete for MySQL Clusters in KubeBlocks

The `instanceUpdateStrategy.type` field supports two values: 'OnDelete' and 'RollingUpdate'.
- 'OnDelete': Updates that require a Pod restart are blocked until the Pods are manually deleted. This provides fine-grained control over updates, as ordered rolling restarts are disabled. You decide when and how to restart the Pods, ensuring minimal disruption to your workload.
- 'RollingUpdate' (default): Updates are applied automatically with ordered rolling restarts. The Operator restarts Pods in a controlled manner to ensure availability and a seamless update process.

By using the OnDelete strategy, you can tailor update behavior to meet specific requirements, such as maintaining maximum stability during updates or scheduling restarts during maintenance windows.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

Deploy a 2-node MySQL cluster with semi-synchronous replication (1 primary, 1 secondary) using the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      instanceUpdateStrategy:
        type: OnDelete
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```


## Verifying the Deployment

Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                     CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Creating   6s
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running    3m47s
```
Once the cluster status becomes Running, your MySQL cluster is ready for use.


## Testing a Pod-Interrupting Update
With the OnDelete update strategy, updates to the cluster that require pod restarts are blocked until the user manually deletes the affected pods.

### Step 1. Trigger Resource Update
Update the resource requests and limits for the MySQL cluster:
```bash
kubectl patch cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo --type='json' -p='[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/resources/limits/cpu",
    "value": "1.0"
  },
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/resources/limits/memory",
    "value": "1.0Gi"
  },
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/resources/requests/cpu",
    "value": "1.0"
  },
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/resources/requests/memory",
    "value": "1.0Gi"
  }
]'
```

### Step 2. Observe Update Blocking
Check the cluster status after applying the patch:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Updating   5m57s
```
The cluster status shows Updating, but the pods remain running without any restarts. This is because the Operator blocks updates requiring pod restarts when the OnDelete strategy is set.

Verify that the pods are still running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```
Expected Output:
```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          6m18s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          4m30s
```

## Applying Changes with Controlled Pod Restarts
To apply the changes, you need to manually delete the affected pods. Kubernetes will recreate them with the updated configuration.

### Restart Pods Sequentially
Delete the pods one at a time to minimize impact on availability with maintenance window control:
```bash
kubectl delete pod example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -n demo --wait=true --grace-period=300
kubectl delete pod example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1 -n demo --wait=true --grace-period=300
```
Monitor the pods as they are recreated:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo  -w
```
Expected Output:
```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          2m21s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          18s
```

Once all Pods are running, the cluster status will update to 'Running':
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo -w
```
Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running   24m
```

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the MySQL cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```


## Summary
In this guide, we demonstrated how to:
- Deploy a MySQL cluster with `OnDelete` as the instance update strategy.
- Triggering a resource update and observing how the Operator blocks pod restarts.
- Manually restart Pods to apply updates in a controlled manner.

By setting `instanceUpdateStrategy` to 'OnDelete', you gain fine-grained control over updates, ensuring that your MySQL clusters remain stable and highly available during configuration changes.
