# Create a MySQL Cluster With Custom Password Generation Policy on KubeBlocks
This guide explains how to deploy a MySQL cluster in KubeBlocks with a custom password generation policy for the root user. By defining specific password rules, you can ensure strong, secure credentials for your cluster.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
  - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
  - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
  - [KubeBlocks CLI](../../user_docs/references/install-kbcli) and [KubeBlocks Operator](../../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploying the MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MySQL clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MySQL cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) in semi-synchronous mode and a custom root password that adheres to a specific pattern.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      systemAccounts:
        - name: root
          passwordConfig:
            length: 20           # Password length: 20 characters
            numDigits: 4         # At least 4 digits
            numSymbols: 4        # At least 4 symbols
            letterCase: MixedCases # Uppercase and lowercase letters
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```
**Key Features of the Password Policy:**
- Length: 20 characters.
- Composition:
  - At least 4 digits.
  - At least 4 symbols.
  - Mixed uppercase and lowercase letters.

This ensures the generated password is strong and secure.

## Verifying the Deployment

Once the cluster is deployed, monitor its status:
```bash
kubectl get cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo -w
NAME                                    CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Creating   10s
example-mysql-cluster   mysql                Delete               Running    1m
```
Wait until the STATUS changes to Running.


## Retrieving the Password

KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the MySQL root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:
```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
Example Output:
```bash
v@DI5PC7n*#3hE#HjRV0
```
This password has the following characteristics:
- Length: 20 characters.
- Composition:
  - 4 digits.
  - 4 symbols.
  - 12 letters (mixed uppercase and lowercase).

This password adheres to the custom policy defined in the configuration.

## Connecting to the MySQL Cluster

To connect to the cluster's primary node, use the MySQL client with the custom password:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -c mysql -- mysql -h example-mysql-cluster-mysql.demo.svc.cluster.local -uroot -pv@DI5PC7n*#3hE#HjRV0
```

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the MySQL cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this tutorial, you:
- Configured and deployed a MySQL cluster with a custom password generation policy using KubeBlocks.
- Verified the deployment and retrieved the generated root password.
- Connected to the MySQL cluster using the secure, auto-generated password.
This approach simplifies password management while maintaining high-security standards for your database deployments.
