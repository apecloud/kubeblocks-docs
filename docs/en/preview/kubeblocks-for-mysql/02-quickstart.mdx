# QuickStart Guide

This guide walks you through the process of getting started with the **KubeBlocks MySQL Add-on**, including prerequisites, enabling the add-on, creating a MySQL cluster, and managing the cluster with ease.


## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have a Kubernetes cluster installed and running, and that you have installed the `kubectl` command line tool and `helm` somewhere in your path. Please see the [getting started](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)  and [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installation instructions for your platform.

Also, this example requires KubeBlocks installed and running. Please see the [Install KubeBlocks](../user_docs/overview/install-kubeblocks) to install KubeBlocks.

### Enable MySQL Add-on

Verify whether MySQL Addon is installed. By default, the MySQL Addon is installed along with the KubeBlocks Helm chart.
```bash
helm list -A
NAME                        	NAMESPACE  	REVISION	UPDATED                                	STATUS  	CHART                       	APP VERSION
...
kb-addon-mysql              	kb-system  	1       	2024-12-16 00:28:52.78819557 +0000 UTC 	deployed	mysql-1.0.0                 	5.7.44
```

If MySQL Addon is not enabled, you can enable it by following the steps below.

```bash
# Add Helm repo
helm repo add kubeblocks-addons https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
# For users in Mainland China, if github is not accessible or very slow for you, please use following repo instead
#helm repo add kubeblocks-addons https://jihulab.com/api/v4/projects/150246/packages/helm/stable

# Update helm repo
helm repo update
# Search versions of the Addon
helm search repo kubeblocks/mysql --versions
# Install the version you want (replace $version with the one you need)
helm upgrade -i mysql kubeblocks-addons/mysql --version $version -n kb-system
```

### Create A MySQL Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-addons/refs/heads/main/examples/mysql/cluster.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # Valid options are: [DoNotTerminate, Delete, WipeOut] (`Halt` is deprecated since KB 0.9)
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the
  # individual Components that make up a Cluster.
  # This field allows for detailed configuration of each Component within the Cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      # Specifies the ComponentDefinition custom resource (CR) that defines the
      # Component's characteristics and behavior.
      # Supports three different ways to specify the ComponentDefinition:
      # - the regular expression - recommended
      # - the full name - recommended
      # - the name prefix
      componentDef: "mysql-8.0"  # match all CMPD named with 'mysql-8.0-'
      # ServiceVersion specifies the version of the Service expected to be
      # provisioned by this Component.
      # When componentDef is "mysql-8.0",
      # Valid options are: [8.0.30,8.0.31,8.0.32,8.0.33,8.0.34,8.0.35,8.0.36,8.0.37,8.0.38,8.0.39]
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      # Determines whether metrics exporter information is annotated on the
      # Component's headless Service.
      # Valid options are [true, false]
      disableExporter: false
      # Specifies the desired number of replicas in the Component
      replicas: 2
      # Specifies the resources required by the Component.
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      # Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that define the storage
      # requirements for the Component.
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        # Refers to the name of a volumeMount defined in
        # `componentDefinition.spec.runtime.containers[*].volumeMounts
        - name: data
          spec:
            # The name of the StorageClass required by the claim.
            # If not specified, the StorageClass annotated with
            # `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true` will be used by default
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                # Set the storage size as needed
                storage: 20Gi
```

If you want to create a cluster of specified version, set `spec.componentSpecs.componentDef` (major version) and `spec.componentSpecs.serviceVersion` (major and minor version) field in the yaml file before applying it, for examples:

```yaml
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      # componentDef is "mysql-5.7" means the major version is 5.7
      componentDef: "mysql-5.7"
      # Valid options are: [5.7.44]
      serviceVersion: 5.7.44
```

```yaml
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      # componentDef is "mysql-8.0" means the major version is 8.0
      componentDef: "mysql-8.0"
      # Valid options are: [8.0.30,8.0.31,8.0.32,8.0.33,8.0.34,8.0.35,8.0.36,8.0.37,8.0.38,8.0.39]
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
```

```yaml
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      # componentDef is "mysql-8.4" means the major version is 8.4
      componentDef: "mysql-8.4"
      # Valid options are: [8.4.0, 8.4.1, 8.4.2]
      serviceVersion: 8.4.2
```

The list of available componentDef can be found by following command:
```bash
kubectl get cmpd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysql
```

The list of supported versions can be found by following command:

```bash
kubectl get cmpv mysql
```

When you create a MySQL cluster, KubeBlocks automatically creates a MySQL cluster that includes one primary replica and one secondary replica. The primary and secondary replicas are synchronized using semi-synchronous replication.

When the cluster's status.phase changes to Running, it indicates that the cluster has been successfully created, and both the primary and secondary replicas have been started.

```bash
kubectl get cluster mysql-cluster
NAME            CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
mysql-cluster                        Delete               Running   22m

kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mysql-cluster
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          31m
mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          31m
```

If you have installed `kbcli`, you can use the `kbcli` tool to quickly view important information related to the cluster.

```bash
kbcli cluster describe mysql-cluster
Name: mysql-cluster	 Created Time: Dec 16,2024 08:37 UTC+0800
NAMESPACE   CLUSTER-DEFINITION   VERSION   STATUS    TERMINATION-POLICY

### Connect to the MySQL Cluster

When creating a MySQL Cluster, KubeBlocks creates a Secret named "mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root" to store the MySQL root username and password.

```bash
kubectl get secret -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mysql-cluster
NAME                                           TYPE     DATA   AGE
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-kbadmin            Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-kbdataprotection   Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-kbmonitoring       Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-kbprobe            Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-kbreplicator       Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-proxysql           Opaque   2      61s
mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root               Opaque   2      61s
```

You can obtain the MySQL root username and password from secret 'mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root' using the following two commands:

```bash
kubectl get secret mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 --decode

kubectl get secret mysql-cluster-mysql-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
```

KubeBlocks by default creates a Service of type ClusterIP named "mysql-cluster-mysql" to access the MySQL Cluster.

```bash
kubectl get svc  -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mysql-cluster
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
mysql-cluster-mysql   ClusterIP   172.20.253.119   <none>        3306/TCP   153m
```

You can log in to a Pod within the Kubernetes cluster, such as the primary replica of the MySQL Cluster, and access the database through this Service. Within the same Kubernetes cluster, the ClusterIP is accessible.

```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n default mysql-cluster-mysql-0 -- mysql -h mysql-cluster-mysql -uroot -pkni676X2W1
```

Alternatively, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command to map port 3306 of the primary replica of the MySQL Cluster to port 3306 on your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/mysql-cluster-mysql 3306:3306 -n default
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3306 -> 3306
Forwarding from [::1]:3306 -> 3306
```

Then, open another shell and use the mysql command-line tool to connect to the local port 3306:

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 -uroot -pkni676X2W1
```

Using `kubectl exec` and `kubectl port-forward` are methods intended for quickly testing the operator's functionality and should not be used in production environments. In production, you should use a Service to access the MySQL Cluster. If accessing the database from outside Kubernetes, a LoadBalancer or NodePort type Service that provides an EXTERNAL-IP is required. Refer to [Accessing MySQL Cluster](./04-operations/05-manage-loadbalancer) to configure the Service in your environment.

### Stop the MySQL Cluster

Stop the cluster will release all the Pods of the cluster, but the PVC, Secret, ConfigMap and Service resources will be retained. It is useful when you want to save the cost of the cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-addons/refs/heads/main/examples/mysql/stop.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mysql-stop
  namespace: demo
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: mysql-cluster
  type: Stop
```

Alternatively, you may stop the cluster by setting the spec.componentSpecs.stop field to true.

```bash
kubectl edit cluster mysql-cluster
```

```yaml
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      stop: true  # set stop `true` to stop the component
      replicas: 2
```

### Start the Stopped MySQL Cluster

Start the stopped cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apecloud/kubeblocks-addons/refs/heads/main/examples/mysql/start.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mysql-start
  namespace: demo
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: mysql-cluster
  type: Start
```

Alternatively, you may start the stopped cluster by setting the spec.componentSpecs.stop field to false.

```bash
kubectl edit cluster mysql-cluster
```

```yaml
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      stop: false  # set to `false` (or remove this field) to start the component
      replicas: 2
```

### Destroy the MySQL Cluster

You can delete the Cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster mysql-cluster
```

The behavior when deleting the Cluster depends on the value of the terminationPolicy field:
- If the terminationPolicy value is DoNotTerminate, deleting the Cluster will not remove any resources related to the Cluster.
- If the terminationPolicy value is Delete, deleting the Cluster will remove all resources related to the Cluster, including PVC, Secret, ConfigMap, and Service.
- If the terminationPolicy value is WipeOut, deleting the Cluster will remove all resources related to the Cluster, including PVC, Secret, ConfigMap, and Service, as well as snapshots and backups in the external storage.

In a testing environment, you can delete the Cluster using the following command to release all resources.

```bash
kubectl patch cluster mysql-cluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"
kubectl delete cluster mysql-cluster
```
