KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MongoDB Replication Clusters.
Below is an example configuration for deploying a MongoDB ReplicaSet Cluster with one primary replica and two secondary replicas.

Apply the following YAML configuration to deploy the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: mongo-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: mongodb
  topology: replicaset
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mongodb
      serviceVersion: "6.0.21"
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```
