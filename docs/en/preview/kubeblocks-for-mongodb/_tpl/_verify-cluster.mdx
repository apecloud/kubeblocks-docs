Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster mongo-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
kubectl get cluster mongo-cluster -n demo
NAME            CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
mongo-cluster   mongodb              Delete               Creating   49s
mongo-cluster   mongodb              Delete               Running    62s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mongo-cluster -L  kubeblocks.io/role -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   ROLE
mongo-cluster-mongodb-0   2/2     Running   0          78s   primary
mongo-cluster-mongodb-1   2/2     Running   0          63s   secondary
mongo-cluster-mongodb-2   2/2     Running   0          48s   secondary
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your MongoDB cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
