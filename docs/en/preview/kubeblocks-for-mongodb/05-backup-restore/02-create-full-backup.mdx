# Create a Full Backup for MongoDB on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to create and validate full backups for MongoDB clusters on KubeBlocks using the `pg-basebackup` method through both:
- The Backup API (direct backup operations)
- The OpsRequest API (managed backup operations with enhanced monitoring)

We will cover how to restore data from a backup in the [Restore From Full Backup](./05-restoring-from-full-backup) guide.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a MongoDB Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Backup Prerequisites

Before creating backups, ensure:
1. Backup repository is configured:
   - `BackupRepo` resource exists
   - Network connectivity between cluster and repository
   - `BackupRepo` status shows "Ready"

2. Cluster is ready:
   - Cluster status is "Running"
   - No ongoing operations (scaling, upgrades, etc.)

## Identify Backup Configuration

Check available backup policies and schedules:

```bash
# List backup policies
kubectl get backuppolicy -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mongo-cluster

# List backup schedules
kubectl get backupschedule -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=mongo-cluster
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                                  BACKUP-REPO   STATUS      AGE
mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy                 Available   62m

NAME                                    STATUS      AGE
mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-schedule   Available   62m
```

View supported backup methods in the BackupPolicy CR 'mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy':

```bash
kubectl get backuppolicy mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy -n demo -oyaml | yq '.spec.backupMethods[].name'
```
**List of Backup methods**

KubeBlocks MongoDB supports these backup methods:

| Feature           | Method          | Description |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Full Backup | dump   | uses `mongodump`, a MongoDB utility used to create a binary export of the contents of a database  |
| Full Backup | datafile | backup the data files of the database |
| Continuous Backup | archive-oplog |Continuously archives MongoDB oplog using `wal-g` |

## Backup via Backup API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

The `datafile` method backup the data files of the database

Apply this manifest to create a backup:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: mongodb-backup-datafile
  namespace: demo
spec:
  # Specifies the backup method name that is defined in the backup policy.
  # - dump
  # - volume-snapshot
  # - datafile
  backupMethod: datafile
  # Specifies the backup policy to be applied for this backup.
  backupPolicyName: mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy
  # Determines whether the backup contents stored in the backup repository should be deleted when the backup custom resource(CR) is deleted. Supported values are `Retain` and `Delete`.
  # - `Retain` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are kept.
  # - `Delete` means that the backup content and its physical snapshot on backup repository are deleted.
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### 2. Monitor Backup and Verify Completion

Track progress until status shows "Completed":

```bash
kubectl get backup mongodb-backup-datafile  -n demo -w
```

Expected Output:

```bash
NAME                      POLICY                                METHOD     REPO            STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME   EXPIRATION-TIME
mongodb-backup-datafile   mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy   datafile   <BACKUP_REPO>   Running     1119698                 Delete            2025-05-18T14:21:16Z
mongodb-backup-datafile   mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy   datafile   <BACKUP_REPO>   Running     1119698                 Delete            2025-05-18T14:21:16Z
mongodb-backup-datafile   mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy   datafile   <BACKUP_REPO>   Completed   1119698      15s        Delete            2025-05-18T14:21:16Z   2025-05-18T14:21:31Z
```

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Check files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Backup file size


## Backup via OpsRequest API

### 1. Create On-Demand Backup

Execute a backup using the OpsRequest API with the 'pg-basebackup' method:

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mongo-cluster-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: mongo-cluster
  force: false
  backup:
    backupPolicyName: mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy
    backupMethod: datafile
    deletionPolicy: Delete
    retentionPeriod: 1mo
  type: Backup
```

### 2. Monitor Backup Progress

#### 1. Monitor Operation Status

Track backup progress in real-time:
```bash
kubectl get ops mongo-cluster-backup  -n demo -w
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                   TYPE     CLUSTER         STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
mongo-cluster-backup   Backup   mongo-cluster   Running   -/-        5s
mongo-cluster-backup   Backup   mongo-cluster   Succeed   -/-        10s
```

- A STATUS of 'Succeed' indicates the backup operation completed successfully.

#### 2. Verify Completion

Check the final backup status:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l operations.kubeblocks.io/ops-name=mongo-cluster-backup
```

Expected Output:
```bash
NAME                                       POLICY                                METHOD     REPO     STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   DELETION-POLICY   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
backup-demo-mongo-cluster-20250518142234   mongo-cluster-mongodb-backup-policy   datafile   kb-oss   Completed   1149575      11s        Delete            2025-05-18T14:22:34Z   2025-05-18T14:22:44Z   2025-06-17T14:22:44Z
```

- The backup status should show 'Completed'.

### 3. Validate Backup

Confirm successful completion by checking:
- Backup status shows "Completed"
- Backup size matches expectations
- Files in the BackupRepo

The `Backup` resource records details including:
- Storage path
- Time range
- Other metadata

## Summary

This guide covered:
1. Deploying a replication MongoDB cluster
2. Creating full backups using:
   - Direct Backup API
   - Managed OpsRequest API
