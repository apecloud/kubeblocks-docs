# Create MongoDB Cluster With Custom Password on KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a MongoDB cluster in KubeBlocks with a custom root password stored in a Kubernetes Secret.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploying the MongoDB ReplicationSet Cluster

KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing MongoDB clusters. Below is an example configuration for deploying a MongoDB cluster with 2 nodes (1 primary, 1 replicas) and a custom root password.

### Step 1: Create a Secret for the Defaults Account

The custom root password is stored in a Kubernetes Secret. Create the Secret by applying the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: Y3VzdG9tcGFzc3dvcmQ= # custompassword
  username: cm9vdA== #root
immutable: true
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-secret
  namespace: demo
```
- password: Replace custompassword with your desired password and encode it using Base64 (`echo -n "custompassword" | base64`).
- username: The default MongoDB root user is 'root', encoded as 'cm9vdA=='.


### Step 2: Deploy the MongoDB Cluster

Apply the following manifest to deploy the MongoDB cluster, referencing the Secret created in Step 1 for the root account:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: mongo-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: mongodb
  topology: replicaset
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mongodb
      serviceVersion: "6.0.16"
      replicas: 3
      systemAccounts:  # override systemaccount password
        - name: root
          secretRef:
            name: custom-secret
            namespace: demo
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```
**Explanation of Key Fields**
- `systemAccounts`: overrides system accounts defined in referenced ComponentDefinition.

:::tip

In KubeBlocks MongoDB Addon, a list of system accounts are defined. And only those accounts can be `customized` with a new secret.

:::

To get the of of accounts:
```bash
kubectl get cmpd mongodb-1.0.0-alpha.0 -oyaml | yq '.spec.systemAccounts[].name'
```

Example Output:
```bash
root
```

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />

## Connecting to the MongoDB Cluster

KubeBlocks automatically creates a secret containing the MongoDB root credentials. Retrieve the credentials with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get secrets -n demo mongo-cluster-mongodb-account-root -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
custompassword
```

To connect to the cluster's primary node, use the MongoDB client with the custom password:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo mongo-cluster-mongodb-0 -c mongodb -- mongosh "mongodb://root:custompassword@127.0.0.1:27017/admin"
```

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the MongoDB cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster mongo-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete secret custom-secret -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you:
- Created a Kubernetes Secret to securely store a custom MongoDB root password.
- Deployed a MongoDB cluster in KubeBlocks with a custom root password.
- Verified the deployment and connected to the cluster's primary node using the MongoDB client.

Using Kubernetes Secrets ensures secure credential management for your MongoDB clusters, while KubeBlocks simplifies the deployment and management process.
