# Vertical Scaling for Milvus Standalone Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to vertically scale a Milvus  Cluster managed by KubeBlocks by adjusting compute resources (CPU and memory) while maintaining the same number of replicas.

Vertical scaling modifies compute resources (CPU/memory) for Milvus instances while maintaining replica count. Key characteristics:

- **Non-disruptive**: When properly configured, maintains availability during scaling
- **Granular**: Adjust CPU, memory, or both independently
- **Reversible**: Scale up or down as needed

KubeBlocks ensures minimal impact during scaling operations by following a controlled, role-aware update strategy:
**Role-Aware Replicas (Primary/Secondary Replicas)**
- Secondary replicas update first – Non-leader pods are upgraded to minimize disruption.
- Primary updates last – Only after all secondaries are healthy does the primary pod restart.
- Cluster state progresses from Updating → Running once all replicas are stable.

**Role-Unaware Replicas (Ordinal-Based Scaling)**
If replicas have no defined roles, updates follow Kubernetes pod ordinal order:
- Highest ordinal first (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0) to ensure deterministic rollouts.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Milvus Cluster

Please refer to [Deploying a Milvus Cluster with KubeBlocks](../03-topologies/02-cluster) to deploy a milvus cluster.

## Vertical Scale

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Pods are updated in pod ordinal order, from highest to lowest, (e.g., pod-2 → pod-1 → pod-0)
1. Cluster status transitions from `Updating` to `Running`

**Check Components**

There are five components in Milvus Cluster. To get the list of components,
```bash
kubectl get cluster -n demo milvus-cluster -oyaml | yq '.spec.componentSpecs[].name'
```

Example Output:
```text
proxy
mixcoord
datanode
indexnode
querynode
```

  <TabItem value="opsRequest" label="OpsRequest API" default>
  Option 1: Using VerticalScaling OpsRequest

  Apply the following YAML to scale up the resources for the **querynode** component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: milvus-cluster-vscale-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: milvus-cluster
    type: VerticalScaling
    verticalScaling:
    - componentName: querynode
      requests:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
      limits:
        cpu: '1'
        memory: 1Gi
  ```

  You can check the progress of the scaling operation with following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n demo get ops milvus-cluster-vscale-ops -w
  ```

  Expected Result:

  ```bash
  NAME                        TYPE              CLUSTER          STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  milvus-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   milvus-cluster   Running   0/2        33s
  milvus-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   milvus-cluster   Running   1/2        55s
  milvus-cluster-vscale-ops   VerticalScaling   milvus-cluster   Running   2/2        88s
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ClusterAPI" label="Cluster API">

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: querynode
        replicas: 1
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
          limits:
            cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
            memory: "1Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
    ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

Milvus Cluster consists of five components. This tutorial shows how to perform changes to one component.
You may perform changes to other components in the same way.

## Best Practices & Considerations

**Planning:**
- Scale during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Verify Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources
- Check for any ongoing operations before starting

**Execution:**
- Maintain balanced CPU:Memory ratios
- Set identical requests/limits for guaranteed QoS

**Post-Scaling:**
- Monitor resource utilization and application performance
- Consider adjusting Milvus parameters if needed

## Verification
Verify the updated resources by inspecting the cluster configuration or Pod details:
```bash
kbcli cluster describe milvus-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
Resources Allocation:
COMPONENT   INSTANCE-TEMPLATE   CPU(REQUEST/LIMIT)   MEMORY(REQUEST/LIMIT)   STORAGE-SIZE   STORAGE-CLASS
milvus                          1 / 1                1Gi / 1Gi               data:20Gi      <none>
```

## Key Benefits of Vertical Scaling with KubeBlocks
- Seamless Scaling: Pods are recreated in a specific order to ensure minimal disruption.
- Dynamic Resource Adjustments: Easily scale CPU and memory based on workload requirements.
- Flexibility: Choose between OpsRequest for dynamic scaling or direct API updates for precise control.
- Improved Availability: The cluster remains operational during the scaling process, maintaining high availability.

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Milvus  Cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster milvus-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide, you learned how to:
1. Deploy a Milvus  Cluster managed by KubeBlocks.
2. Perform vertical scaling by increasing or decreasing resources for the milvus component.
3. Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates to adjust resource allocations.

Vertical scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource utilization and adapting to changing workload demands, ensuring your Milvus  Cluster remains performant and resilient.
