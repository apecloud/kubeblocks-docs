- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - KubeBlocks CLI and KubeBlocks Operator are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```
