Monitor the cluster status until it transitions to the Running state:
```bash
kubectl get cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo -w
```

Example Output:

```bash
kubectl get cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo
NAME             CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS     AGE
qdrant-cluster   qdrant              Delete               Creating   49s
qdrant-cluster   qdrant              Delete               Running    62s
```

Check the pod status and roles:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=qdrant-cluster -n demo
```

Example Output:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-0   2/2     Running   0          1m43s
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-1   2/2     Running   0          1m28s
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-2   2/2     Running   0          1m14s
```

Once the cluster status becomes Running, your Qdrant cluster is ready for use.

:::tip
If you are creating the cluster for the very first time, it may take some time to pull images before running.
