KubeBlocks uses a declarative approach for managing Qdrant Replication Clusters.
Below is an example configuration for deploying a Qdrant ReplicationSet Cluster with one one primary replica and two secondary replicas.

Apply the following YAML configuration to deploy the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: qdrant-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: qdrant
  topology: cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: qdrant
      serviceVersion: 1.10.0
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```
