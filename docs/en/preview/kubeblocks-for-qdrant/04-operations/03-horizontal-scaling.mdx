# Horizontal Scaling for Qdrant Clusters with KubeBlocks

This guide explains how to perform horizontal scaling (scale-out and scale-in) on a Qdrant cluster managed by KubeBlocks. You'll learn how to use both **OpsRequest** and direct **Cluster API** updates to achieve this.

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Deploy a Qdrant Cluster

import CreateCluster from '../_tpl/_create-cluster.mdx'

<CreateCluster />

## Verifying the Deployment

import VerifyCluster from '../_tpl/_verify-cluster.mdx'

<VerifyCluster />


## Scale-out (Add Replicas)

**Expected Workflow**:

1. New pod is provisioned, and transitions from `Pending` to `Running` with `secondary` role.
2. Cluster status changes from `Updating` to `Running`

:::note

Qdrant uses the **Raft consensus protocol** to maintain consistency regarding the cluster topology and the collections structure.
Better to have an odd number of replicas, such as 3, 5, 7, to avoid split-brain scenarios, after scaling out/in the cluster.

  Option 1: Using Horizontal Scaling OpsRequest

  Scale out the Qdrant cluster by adding 1 replica to qdrant component:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: qdrant-cluster-scale-out-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: qdrant-cluster
    type: HorizontalScaling
    horizontalScaling:
    - componentName: qdrant
      # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
      scaleOut:
        # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
        # add one more replica to current component
        replicaChanges: 1
  ```

  Monitor the progress of the scaling operation:

  ```bash
  kubectl get ops qdrant-cluster-scale-out-ops -n demo -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                           TYPE                CLUSTER          STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  qdrant-cluster-scale-out-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   0/1        9s
  qdrant-cluster-scale-out-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   1/1        16s
  qdrant-cluster-scale-out-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Succeed   1/1        16s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you can perform a direct update to the `replicas` field in the Cluster resource:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: qdrant
        replicas: 4 # increase replicas to scale-out
  ...
  ```

  Or you can patch the cluster CR with command:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo --type=json -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/replicas", "value": 4}]'
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify Scale-Out

After applying the operation, you will see a new pod created and the Qdrant cluster status goes from `Updating` to `Running`, and the newly created pod has a new role `secondary`.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=qdrant-cluster
```

Expected Outputs:
```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-0   2/2     Running   0          6m24s
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-1   2/2     Running   0          7m19s
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-2   2/2     Running   0          5m57s
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-3   2/2     Running   0          3m54s
```

## Scale-in (Remove Replicas)

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Selected replica (the one with the largest ordinal) is removed
3. Pod is terminated gracefully
4. Cluster status changes from `Updating` to `Running`

:::note

On Qdrant scale-in, data will be redistributed among the remaining replicas. Make sure the cluster have enough capacity to accommodate the data.
The data redistribution process may take some time depending on the amount of data.
It is handled by Qdrant `MemberLeave` operation, and Pods won't be deleted until the data redistribution, i.e. the `MemberLeave` actions completed successfully.

  Option 1: Using Horizontal Scaling OpsRequest

  Scale in the Qdrant cluster by removing ONE replica:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
  kind: OpsRequest
  metadata:
    name: qdrant-cluster-scale-in-ops
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    clusterName: qdrant-cluster
    type: HorizontalScaling
    horizontalScaling:
    - componentName: qdrant
      # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
      scaleIn:
        # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
        # add one more replica to current component
        replicaChanges: 1
  ```

  Monitor progress:
  ```bash
  kubectl get ops qdrant-cluster-scale-in-ops -n demo -w
  ```

  Expected Result:
  ```bash
  NAME                         TYPE                 CLUSTER          STATUS    PROGRESS   AGE
  qdrant-cluster-scale-in-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   0/1        8s
  qdrant-cluster-scale-in-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Running   1/1        24s
  qdrant-cluster-scale-in-ops   HorizontalScaling   qdrant-cluster   Succeed   1/1        24s
  ```
  </TabItem>

  Option 2: Direct Cluster API Update

  Alternatively, you can perform a direct update to the `replicas` field in the Cluster resource:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
  kind: Cluster
  spec:
    componentSpecs:
      - name: qdrant
        replicas: 1 # decrease replicas to scale-out
  ```

  Or you can patch the cluster CR with command:

  ```bash
  kubectl patch cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo --type=json -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/componentSpecs/0/replicas", "value": 1}]'
  ```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Verify Scale-In

Expected Output (ONE Pod):
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=qdrant-cluster
NAME                        READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
qdrant-cluster-qdrant-0     2/2     Running  0          18m
```

## Troubleshooting

On scale-in, KubeBlocks Qdrant will redistribute data in following steps:

1. Cluster Information Gathering:

- Identifies the leaving member
- Retrieves cluster state including peer IDs and leader information

2. Data Migration:

- Discovers all collections on the leaving member
- For each collection, finds all local shards
- Moves each shard to the cluster leader
- Verifies successful shard transfer before proceeding

3. Cluster Membership Update:

- Removes the leaving peer from the cluster membership
- Uses file locking to prevent concurrent removal operations


If the scale-in operations gets stuck for quite a long time, please check these resources:

```bash
# Check agent logs
kubectl logs -n demo <pod-name> -c kbagent

# Check cluster events for errors
kubectl get events -n demo --field-selector involvedObject.name=pg-cluster

# Check kubeblocks logs
kubectl -n kb-system logs deploy/kubeblocks
```

## Best Practices

When performing horizontal scaling:
- Scale during low-traffic periods when possible
- Monitor cluster health during scaling operations
- Verify sufficient resources exist before scaling out
- Consider storage requirements for new replicas

## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Qdrant cluster along with its namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary
In this guide you learned how to:
- Perform scale-out operations to add replicas to a Qdrant cluster.
- Perform scale-in operations to remove replicas from a Qdrant cluster.
- Use both OpsRequest and direct Cluster API updates for horizontal scaling.
KubeBlocks ensures seamless scaling with minimal disruption to your database operations.
