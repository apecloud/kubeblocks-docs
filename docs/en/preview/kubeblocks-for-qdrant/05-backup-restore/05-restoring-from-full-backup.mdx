# Restore a Qdrant Cluster from Backup

This guide demonstrates two methods to restore a Qdrant cluster from backup in KubeBlocks:

1. **Cluster Annotation Method** - Simple declarative approach using YAML annotations
2. **OpsRequest API Method** - Enhanced operational control with progress monitoring

## Prerequisites

import Prerequisites from '../_tpl/_prerequisites.mdx'

<Prerequisites />

## Preparing for Restoration: Locate one Full Backup
Before restoring, ensure that there is a full backup available. The restoration process will use this backup to create a new Qdrant cluster.

- Backup repository accessible from new cluster
- Valid full backup in `Completed` state
- Adequate CPU/memory resources
- Sufficient storage capacity

Find available full backups:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo -l dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/backup-type=Full,app.kubernetes.io/instance=qdrant-cluster # get the list of full backups
```

Pick ONE of the Backups whose status is `Completed`.

## Option 1: Cluster Annotation Restoration

### Step 1: Create Restored Cluster
Create a new cluster with restore configuration:

Key parameters:
- `kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup` annotation
- Backup name and namespace located from the previous steps


```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: qdrant-cluster-restored
  namespace: demo
  annotations:
    # NOTE: replace <FULL_BACKUP_NAME> with your backup
    kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup: '{"qdrant":{"name":"<FULL_BACKUP_NAME>","namespace":"demo","volumeRestorePolicy":"Parallel"}}'
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDef: qdrant
  topology: cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: qdrant
      serviceVersion: 1.10.0
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
```

### Step 2: Monitor Restoration
Track restore progress with:

```bash
# Watch restore status
kubectl get restore -n demo -w

# Watch cluster status
kubectl get cluster -n demo -w
```

## Option 2: OpsRequest API Restoration

### Step 1: Initiate Restore Operation
Create restore request via OpsRequest API:

```yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: qdrant-cluster-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterName: qdrant-cluster-restored
  force: false
  restore:
    backupName: <FULL_BACKUP_NAME>
    backupNamespace: demo
  type: Restore
```

### Step 2: Track Operation Progress
Monitor restore status:

```bash
# Watch restore status
kubectl get restore -n demo -w

# Watch cluster status
kubectl get cluster -n demo -w
```

### Step 3: Validate Restored Cluster
Confirm successful restoration:
```bash
kubectl get cluster qdrant-cluster-restored -n demo
```
Example Output:
```bash
NAME                     CLUSTER-DEFINITION   TERMINATION-POLICY   STATUS    AGE
qdrant-cluster-restored  qdrant              Delete               Running   3m3s
```


## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the Qdrant cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster qdrant-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete cluster qdrant-cluster-restored -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Summary

This guide covered two restoration methods:

1. **Cluster Annotation** - Simple YAML-based approach
   - Retrieve system credentials
   - Create cluster with restore annotation
   - Monitor progress

2. **OpsRequest API** - Enhanced operational control
   - Create restore request
   - Track operation status
   - Verify completion
