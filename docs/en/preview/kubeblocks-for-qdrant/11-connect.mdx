## Connect to a Qdrant cluster

Qdrant provides both HTTP and gRPC protocols for client access on ports 6333 and 6334 respectively. Depending on where the client is, different connection options are offered to connect to the Qdrant cluster.

1. Run the following command to port forward the service.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/mycluster-qdrant 6333:6333 -n demo
   ```

2. Open a new terminal and run the following command to connect to the database.

   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:6333/collections
   ```

   Refer to [the official Qdrant documents](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) for the cluster operations.

:::note

If your cluster is on AWS, install the AWS Load Balancer Controller first.

:::

- If your client is inside a K8s cluster, run `kbcli cluster describe mycluster -n demo` to get the ClusterIP address of the cluster or the corresponding K8s cluster domain name.
- If your client is outside the K8s cluster but in the same VPC as the server, run `kbcli cluster expose mycluster -n demo --enable=true --type=vpc` to get a VPC load balancer address for the database cluster.
- If your client is outside the VPC, run `kbcli cluster expose mycluster -n demo --enable=true --type=internet` to open a public network reachable address for the database cluster.
