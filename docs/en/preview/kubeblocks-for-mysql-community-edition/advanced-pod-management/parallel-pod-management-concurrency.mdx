# Configuring a MySQL Cluster with Controlled Pod Creation, Scaling, and Deletion Parallelism in KubeBlocks

This guide demonstrates how to control pod creation, scaling, and deletion parallelism for MySQL clusters in KubeBlocks using the `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` parameter. By defining the maximum number of pods that can be managed in parallel, it allows users to balance operational speed and system stability. Unlike the `podManagementPolicy` in StatefulSet, which only provides two fixed options (`OrderedReady` or `Parallel`), `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` offers more flexibility, making it ideal for both resource-sensitive and production environments.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
- Environment Setup:
    - A Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
    - The kubectl CLI tool is configured to communicate with your cluster.
    - KubeBlocks CLI and KubeBlocks Operator are installed. Follow the installation instructions here.
- Namespace Preparation: To keep resources isolated, create a dedicated namespace for this tutorial:

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Deploy a MySQL Semi-Synchronous Cluster

Deploy a 2-node semi-sync MySQL cluster (1 primary, 1 secondary) and set the `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` parameter to 1 to enforce sequential pod creation.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      parallelPodManagementConcurrency: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```
**Key Parameter:**
- The `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` parameter is set to 1, which ensures that the pods are created sequentially rather than in parallel.

## Monitor Pod Creation
Run the following command to monitor the creation and initialization of the MySQL pods in the demo namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n demo -w
```

Sample Output:

Below is an example of the output when deploying the cluster. Notice how the pods are created sequentially due to the `parallelPodManagementConcurrency: 1` setting:

```bash

example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running           0          17s
```
***Key Observations:***
- 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0' completes initialization and enters the Running state before 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1' begins its initialization.
- This sequential behavior is controlled by the `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` parameter.


## Scaling Out the Cluster

To scale the cluster to 4 replicas, use the following configuration:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: semisync
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 4
      parallelPodManagementConcurrency: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

Sample Output:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n demo -w
NAME                            READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE

example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   4/4     Running           0          21s
```
**Key Observations:**
- New Pods ('example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2' and 'example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3') are created sequentially, following the same pattern as the initial deployment.
- Each Pod completes initialization before the next Pod begins.


## Scaling In the Cluster

To reduce the cluster back to 2 replicas, apply the following configuration:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: example-mysql-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterDef: mysql
  topology: server
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      serviceVersion: 8.0.35
      replicas: 2
      parallelPodManagementConcurrency: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
        requests:
          cpu: '0.5'
          memory: 0.5Gi
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

Sample Output:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n demo -w
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          36m
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          34m
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2   4/4     Running   0          48s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   4/4     Running   0          31s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   4/4     Terminating   0          51s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   0/4     Completed     0          53s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   0/4     Completed     0          54s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-3   0/4     Completed     0          54s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2   4/4     Terminating   0          71s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2   0/4     Completed     0          73s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2   0/4     Completed     0          74s
example-mysql-cluster-mysql-2   0/4     Completed     0          74s
```
**Key Observations:**
- Pods are terminated sequentially, following the same pattern as creation and scaling out.


## Cleanup
To remove all created resources, delete the MySQL cluster along with its namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete cluster example-mysql-cluster -n demo
kubectl delete ns demo
```


## Explanation of parallelPodManagementConcurrency
The `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` parameter defines the maximum number of Pods that can be created or deleted in parallel. 

### Behaviors:
- When set to 1, it enforces sequential Pod creation, scaling, and deletion. This behavior ensures the primary Pod must be fully initialized before the secondary Pod starts.
- When set to a higher value (e.g., 2, 3): Multiple Pods can be created or deleted simultaneously, up to the specified concurrency limit.
- When not set (default behavior): All Pods are created or deleted in parallel without any concurrency limit.

It is similar to the `podManagementPolicy` of StatefulSet. However, `podManagementPolicy` in StatefulSet only provides two options: fully ordered ('OrderedReady') or fully parallel ('Parallel'). In contrast, `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` offers more fine-grained control.


### Why Use parallelPodManagementConcurrency?
This parameter provides fine-grained control over Pod management, allowing you to balance speed and stability based on your application needs. Below are the key benefits:

- **Avoiding Resource Contention**: In resource-limited clusters, creating multiple Pods in parallel can lead to resource competition, causing some Pods to remain in a Pending state. Sequential Pod creation ensures even resource allocation and prevents overwhelming the cluster.

- **Simplifying Debugging**: Sequential creation makes it easier to identify and resolve issues. If a Pod fails to start due to an error, it can be fixed before proceeding, avoiding simultaneous failures and simplifying troubleshooting.

- **Improving Stability**: For scaling or updates, creating Pods one at a time ensures dependencies are respected, reducing the risk of conflicts or instability in stateful applications.

- **Preventing Service Interruptions**: Sequential creation ensures each Pod is fully ready before the next starts, maintaining availability and avoiding downtime, especially for applications with strict readiness requirements.


## Summary

Through this guide, we demonstrated:
- How to configure `parallelPodManagementConcurrency` for sequential pod creation, scaling, and deletion.
- The benefits of sequential pod management, such as avoiding resource contention, simplifying debugging, and improving system stability.
- How to scale MySQL clusters both up and down with controlled pod parallelism.

Using `parallelPodManagementConcurrency`, you can optimize pod management to suit your workload's unique requirements while ensuring high availability and efficient resource usage.
