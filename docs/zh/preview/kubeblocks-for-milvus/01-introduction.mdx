# Milvus

Milvus is an open source (Apache-2.0 licensed) vector database built to power embedding similarity search and AI applications. Milvus's architecture is designed to handle large-scale vector datasets and includes various deployment modes:  Milvus Standalone, and Milvus Distributed, to accommodate different data scale needs.

- Standalone Mode, including three components:
  - Milvus: Provides the core functionality of the system.
  - Metadata Storage (ETCD): A metadata engine for accessing and storing metadata of Milvus internal components (including proxies, index nodes, etc.), typically using etcd.
  - Object Storage (minio): A storage engine responsible for the persistence of Milvus data, typically using MinIO or S3-compatible storage services.

- Cluster Mode, including multiple layers:
  - Access Layer: composed of a group of stateless proxies
  - Worker Nodes:
    - Query Nodes
    - Data Nodes
    - Index Nodes
  - Coordinator Service: Manages the metadata of the cluster, including Root, Query , Data, and Index Coordinators.
  - Storage Layer, including
    - Metadata Storage (ETCD): A metadata engine for accessing and storing metadata of Milvus internal components, typically using etcd.
    - Object Storage (minio): A storage engine responsible for the persistence of Milvus data, typically using MinIO or S3-compatible storage services.
    - Log Storage (Pulsar): A log storage engine responsible for the persistence of Milvus logs, typically using Apache Pulsar.
