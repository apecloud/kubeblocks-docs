## Background

### MSSQL and Always On AG

Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is an enterprise-level relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It has a history of over 30 years since its first version, SQL Server 1.0, was released in 1989. According to the [DB-Engines Ranking Trend](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend), MSSQL has consistently ranked among the top three globally for the past decade, second only to Oracle and MySQL, making it one of the industry's recognized mainstream database products.

In enterprise production environments, database high availability is a crucial guarantee for business continuity. MSSQL's Always On Availability Group (AG) technology provides enterprises with a mature high-availability solution through multi-replica synchronous replication and automatic failover, effectively preventing data loss and minimizing service downtime. Therefore, Always On AG has become a standard configuration for enterprise-level MSSQL deployments and an indispensable data protection technology for critical business systems.

### Operatorization Challenges

With the rapid development of cloud-native infrastructure, more enterprises are running MSSQL on Kubernetes using an operator-centric approach. Compared with simply running container images, operatorization embeds domain-aware lifecycle logic, CRD-driven automation, and orchestration workflows that go beyond basic image start/stop semantics.
KubeBlocks can be seen as an operator-focused, unified framework for stateful services and is an optional alternative to dedicated, single-engine operators. For MSSQL, community or vendor projects exist with names such as "mssql-operator" or "sqlserver-operator" that aim to provide operator-style management; KubeBlocks offers a more generic, extensible Addon model that can serve as an alternative to those dedicated operators.

#### Limitations of image-and-StatefulSet-centric solutions

Although Microsoft provides deployment guidance for [running MSSQL in containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment) and [in Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-kubernetes-best-practices-statefulsets), those StatefulSet-based or image-centric deployment approaches are often inadequate for enterprise scenarios with high requirements for availability and business continuity:

* **Single-Replica Architecture Limitation**: Typical examples and best practices recommend one SQL Server instance per Pod, which by itself does not achieve true database-level high availability.
* **Poor Availability**: Availability often relies on persistent volumes and Pod reconstruction. Fault recovery time can be several minutes, producing an RTO that may not meet critical business SLAs.
* **High Operational Complexity**: Image-and-StatefulSet deployments lack unified lifecycle automation for AG initialization, automated failover coordination, backup orchestration, and cluster-aware parameter management.

#### Operatorization Challenges of Always On AG

Although Always On AG technology is mature in traditional environments, bringing AG into an operatorized Kubernetes environment raises fundamental challenges:

* **Missing cluster-level HA primitives**: Traditional Always On AG depends on OS-level cluster services (e.g., WSFC on Windows or Pacemaker on Linux) to coordinate automatic failover. Those components are hard to adapt to ephemeral container semantics, so operator-based alternatives or cloud-native helpers are required.
* **Complex networking and service discovery**: AG endpoints normally use stable network identities; dynamic Pod IPs require stable FQDNs, headless services, and careful certificate management to secure endpoints across replicas.
* **Complex multi-replica lifecycle**: AG formation needs ordered initialization, certificate and endpoint provisioning, role assignment, and continuous health monitoring. Any misstep in startup ordering or configuration synchronization can break cluster behavior.

Against this backdrop, KubeBlocks offers an operator-centric solution for running MSSQL Always On AG. This article will introduce how to implement MSSQL operatorization based on the open-source KubeBlocks, including its Addon integration mechanism, the implementation of the MSSQL Always On AG Addon, and finally, a demonstration of actual deployment and operational effects.

## KubeBlocks and Addon

KubeBlocks, as an open-source K8s Operator framework designed specifically for stateful applications, enables developers to implement MSSQL operatorization based on a unified abstraction layer and automated operational capabilities. KubeBlocks has the following features:

* **Open Source**: An open-source project based on the AGPL license.
* **Cloud-Native Design**: Deeply integrated with the K8s ecosystem, fully leveraging the native advantages of container orchestration.
* **Unified Management**: Provides a consistent database operations experience, simplifying the management complexity of multi-database environments.
* **Extensible Architecture**: A plugin-based design that supports developers in custom-integrating various types of databases.

The plugin-based design of KubeBlocks provides a set of interfaces for us to integrate MSSQL. By implementing these interfaces, KubeBlocks can run and manage MSSQL database clusters on K8s.

These interfaces are like the connection points of Lego bricks: whether it's a block for building a house, a wheel for a car, or an arm for a robot, as long as your studs and sockets conform to the standard Lego specifications, they can connect perfectly with other bricks to build complex creations. Similarly, KubeBlocks defines a standard set of "database brick" interface specifications. Any database that "designs its connection points" according to these specifications can be seamlessly integrated into the KubeBlocks platform and work collaboratively with other components.

In KubeBlocks, these interfaces correspond to a set of APIs, which are a group of K8s CRD definitions, as shown in the figure below with `ClusterDefinition`, `ComponentVersion`, and `ComponentDefinition`. By defining the corresponding CRs, you can integrate a database engine, which we also call an Addon (plugin). The purpose and description of these interfaces will be introduced in the context of the specific implementation for integrating MSSQL below.

## MSSQL Addon Implementation

This section describes how we implement features like MSSQL cluster management, high availability, parameter configuration, and backup/restore.

### Cluster Management

By implementing the following interfaces, you can manage the basic lifecycle and operations of an MSSQL cluster in KubeBlocks:

* **ClusterDefinition**: An interface to define the database cluster topology, such as whether it's a cluster or a single instance, and which components are included in each topology.
* **ComponentDefinition**: An interface to define a component. A component is a part of a database cluster, which is usually composed of one or more components. If a database cluster is like a Lego car, components represent different functional parts, like headlights, wheels, and the car body.
* **ComponentVersion**: An interface to define component versions. Each component usually has many versions. This interface defines which major and minor versions we support, the corresponding images for each version, and the compatibility between versions.

Here, we will mainly introduce the implementation of `ComponentDefinition`. Note that the MSSQL Addon described in this article is based on the KubeBlocks 0.9 API.

The `ComponentDefinition` for MSSQL mainly includes the following parts:

* **roles**: Defines the replica roles in the AG cluster, which are `primary` and `secondary`.
* **services**: Defines two services for external access: one pointing to the primary replica for read-write services, and one pointing to the secondary replicas for read-only services.
* **systemAccounts**: Defines the built-in system accounts `sa` and `kbadmin`, and their password generation policies. KubeBlocks will generate the corresponding account and password information into the respective secrets.
* **scripts**: Specifies the ConfigMap for scripts, which KubeBlocks will mount to a specified directory in the container.
* **vars**: Defines some variables, such as `MSSQL_SA_USER` for the database cluster system administrator account name, and `MSSQL_SERVER_PORT` for the service port number. These variables will eventually be rendered as environment variables in the Pod.
* **lifecycleActions**: Defines some lifecycle management-related actions. MSSQL implements two Actions:
  * `roleProbe`: Used to probe the role of a replica.
  * `memberLeave`: Used to adjust the topological relationship between replicas during cluster scale-in.
* **runtime**: Defines the container runtime-related configuration, including three containers:
  * `init-syncer`: Copies necessary tools like Syncer.
  * `mssql`: The container where the MSSQL service runs.
  * `exporter`: Used to collect database monitoring metrics.

With this, a basic MSSQL component is defined.

### Always On AG Configuration

Astute readers might wonder, how does the component start the MSSQL service? And how do the multiple replicas of the component form an AG cluster? How are the previously mentioned operatorization challenges for Always On AG overcome?

The key details and complexities lie in the startup script of the `mssql` container. When the container starts, it first launches the MSSQL process and then executes different flows depending on whether initialization has already been performed. During initialization, the Pod with the smallest serial number is chosen as the primary node, and the remaining Pods become secondary nodes.

The initialization process for the primary node includes the following steps:

1. Wait for the MSSQL process to start on all replicas.
2. Create a certificate, which will be used for TDE encryption.
3. Create an Endpoint.
4. Create an AG that includes all replicas, using the Pod's FQDN as the connection address.
5. Grant AG operation permissions to the management account `kbadmin`.
6. Enable and configure service-level and database-level auditing.
7. Create triggers and stored procedures for synchronizing accounts and databases.

The initialization process for secondary nodes is similar, with the difference that they do not create the AG but join the one already created by the primary node. Once all nodes are initialized and have joined the same AG, they form an AG cluster.

### High Availability

However, the AG cluster itself does not have automatic failover capabilities and relies on external components. In a Linux environment, traditional automatic failover typically depends on Pacemaker and Corosync. However, these components are cumbersome to configure in a containerized environment and are not fully adapted to it, leading to high maintenance costs and questionable stability for the overall high-availability system. To address this, we independently developed a lightweight, multi-database engine-supported, cloud-native distributed high-availability component called Syncer. For more details on the high-availability design of KubeBlocks for MSSQL, the specific implementation of Syncer, and how to use Chaos Mesh to improve cluster availability, please refer to [KubeBlocks for MSSQL High Availability Implementation](./kubeblocks-for-mssql-high-availability-implementation).

### Parameter Configuration

Database engines usually have many parameters and configurations. Some need to be specified during initialization, some need to be specified in configuration files, some parameter changes require restart to take effect, and some can be modified dynamically. To facilitate integration of different types and formats of database parameter configurations, KubeBlocks defines parameter configuration-related interfaces:

* Parameter template: Defines a parameter template. KubeBlocks will adaptively render it into configuration files based on cluster resources
* ConfigConstraint: Configuration constraints that define the format of configuration files, dynamic and static parameters, and parameter value ranges, types, and other information

In the MSSQL Addon, according to MSSQL startup requirements, parameter templates are defined to render the `mssql.conf` configuration file, which MSSQL will use when starting. At the same time, ConfigConstraint is defined to specify its supported configuration file format as `ini`, as well as dynamic parameters, static parameters, and immutable parameters.

### Backup and Recovery

The importance of backup for database systems is self-evident. In case of accidents such as mistaken deletion of databases/tables, hardware failures, natural disasters, etc., data loss and service interruption may occur, affecting online business. Through regular backups and saving backup data to different regions and different storage media, data can be recovered through backup in extreme situations.

KubeBlocks defines two interfaces to implement backup for database systems:

* BackupPolicyTemplate: Backup policy template used to define backup policies for specified components. When creating database clusters, cluster backup policies will be generated based on this template. It includes backup methods, default backup scheduling cycles, and default backup targets (i.e., whether to backup from primary or secondary nodes).
* ActionSet: Defines actual behaviors corresponding to specific backup methods and backup types.

We implemented three backup methods for the MSSQL Addon:

* Full backup: Calls MSSQL commands to backup all databases
* Differential backup: Differential backup only backs up modifications since the last full backup, which is more efficient than full backup. It's also implemented by calling MSSQL differential backup commands
* Continuous log backup: Regularly calls the `BACKUP LOG` command to upload database log files to achieve point-in-time recovery

With the help of KubeBlocks' abstraction of backup destinations, namely BackupRepo, the above backups can be easily uploaded to object storage provided by mainstream cloud vendors, including object storage services from Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, etc. For on-premise deployment scenarios, it also supports self-deployed storage services such as MinIO, XSKY, NAS, etc.

## Deployment and Operational Practice

Now, let's actually deploy an MSSQL Always On AG cluster and perform some operational change operations. (Note: The MSSQL Addon is currently only available in the enterprise edition and has not been open-sourced yet)

### Cluster Deployment

Create a three-replica MSSQL cluster by applying a cluster YAML file with kubectl command.

```Bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-mssql
  annotations:
    kubeblocks.io/extra-env: '{"MSSQL_PID":"Developer","MSSQL_COLLATION":"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"}'
spec:
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  clusterDefinitionRef: mssql
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mssql
      serviceVersion: 2022.19.0
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "2Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "2Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

Check the cluster and pod status:

![Cluster and pod status](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/3-cluster-pod-status.png)

### Automatic Failover

Simulate node failure by deleting a pod to check if roles automatically switch. As shown below, after deleting the current primary node my-mssql-mssql-0, my-mssql-mssql-1's role changes to primary within a few seconds.

![Automatic failover](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/4-failover.png)

Subsequently, the my-mssql-mssql-0 node's role changes to secondary, joining the cluster as a new secondary node.

![Automatic failover](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/5-failover.png)

### Vertical Scaling

Execute the following OpsRequest to scale cpu/memory from 1C2G to 2C4G.

```YAML
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: ops-vertical-scaling
spec:
  clusterName: my-mssql
  type: VerticalScaling
  verticalScaling:
  - componentName: mssql
    requests:
      memory: "4Gi"
      cpu: "2"
    limits:
      memory: "4Gi"
      cpu: "2"
EOF
```

Check the cluster status and Pod status, wait for the change to complete, and check Pod resources.

![Vertical scaling](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/6-vertical-scaling.png)

### Backup and Recovery

Execute the following command to create a full backup:

```YAML
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: mssql-cluster-backup
spec:
  backupMethod: full
  backupPolicyName: my-mssql-mssql-backup-policy
  deletionPolicy: Delete
EOF
```

Check the backup as follows:

![Backup](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/7-backup.png)

Restore a brand new cluster based on this backup:

```YAML
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mssql-cluster-restore-ops
spec:
  clusterName: my-mssql-restored
  force: false
  restore:
    backupName: mssql-cluster-backup
    backupNamespace: demo
  type: Restore
EOF
opsrequest.apps.kubeblocks.io/mssql-cluster-restore-ops created
```

Check the status of the restored cluster:

![Restore](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/8-restore.png)

![Restore](/img/blogs/mssql-addon/9-restore.png)

### Other Operational Operations

After integrating with KubeBlocks in Addon form, it naturally supports many cluster operational operations. Besides the automatic failover, vertical scaling, and backup and recovery introduced above, it also supports the following operational operations:

* Horizontal scaling, increasing the number of cluster replicas
* Storage scaling
* Manual primary-secondary switching
* Cluster restart, stop, and deletion
* Parameter configuration, modifying cluster parameters
* Minor version upgrades
* Incremental backup
* Point-in-time recovery
* Monitoring (configuring Prometheus exporter to collect metrics)

## Summary and Outlook

Running MSSQL in cloud-native environments faces many challenges. KubeBlocks, as an open-source K8s Operator framework designed specifically for stateful applications, provides strong support for operator-based MSSQL deployments. This article detailed how to implement an MSSQL Addon supporting Always On AG based on open-source KubeBlocks and demonstrated its advantages in operatorized deployment, high availability, and automated operations. Currently, KubeBlocks for MSSQL has been launched in [KubeBlocks Enterprise Edition](https://www.apecloud.cn/products/kubeblocks-enterprise). Interested readers are welcome to apply for experience.

Although KubeBlocks has solved many key problems of MSSQL Always On AG operatorization, it still faces some challenges in enterprise application scenarios, such as existing tool ecosystem integration, AD domain integration, etc., which we are actively solving and improving. We believe that by continuously solving these practical pain points in enterprise scenarios, operatorized MSSQL will truly become a trusted choice for enterprise data management.
