Leading Chinese internet companies have accumulated massive user bases and business scales from their inception, with data volumes and concurrent access patterns far exceeding typical enterprises. In their infrastructure decisions, these companies often favor self-built data centers over complete reliance on public cloud services, driven by several strategic considerations:

1. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Optimization:** For hyperscale internet companies with massive server and bandwidth requirements, self-built data centers often provide better long-term economics compared to public cloud services. While public clouds offer pay-as-you-go flexibility, at scale, the cumulative costs can become prohibitive. Self-built infrastructure allows for economies of scale through bulk procurement and optimized operations.

2. **Performance Engineering and Hardware Customization:** Mission-critical workloads demand extreme performance characteristics—from handling instantaneous traffic spikes during shopping festivals to real-time content delivery for video platforms. Self-built data centers enable deep hardware customization and network architecture optimization tailored to specific workload requirements. While public clouds offer diverse instance types, they provide limited flexibility in underlying hardware specifications and network topology design.

3. **Data Sovereignty and Regulatory Compliance:** With increasingly stringent data protection regulations, these companies maintain strict internal controls over data storage, processing, and transmission. Self-built data centers provide enhanced physical security controls and data sovereignty, facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements while minimizing data breach risks.

4. **Technical Innovation and Competitive Differentiation:** These companies possess substantial R&D capabilities and seek complete control over their infrastructure stack to enable deep optimization, rapid troubleshooting, and technical innovation. Self-built data centers provide the foundation for developing proprietary technologies—custom scheduling systems, storage solutions, and network components—creating unique technical moats and competitive advantages.

5. **Vendor Independence and Architectural Flexibility:** While public clouds offer convenience, they also introduce vendor lock-in risks. Leading internet companies typically avoid binding their entire technology stack to a single cloud provider, maintaining architectural flexibility through self-built infrastructure and multi-cloud strategies to reduce vendor dependencies.

This self-built infrastructure strategy creates a compelling use case for Kubernetes. K8s enables these companies to build efficient, elastic, and automated cloud-native platforms on top of their physical infrastructure, maximizing the benefits of self-built data centers while gaining the operational advantages of containerization and cloud-native technologies. Running databases on K8s represents a natural evolution of this strategic approach.

## Challenges Faced

Despite the many advantages of running databases on K8s, there are also some challenges:

1. **Stateful Application Management Complexity:** Databases, as stateful applications, face unique challenges on Kubernetes due to the limitations of StatefulSet. It lacks awareness of database roles (e.g., primary, secondary), cannot optimize operations like upgrades based on these roles, enforces strict sequential Pod updates, and does not support heterogeneous configurations within a single StatefulSet. These shortcomings require custom solutions to effectively manage storage, networking, and scheduling for databases in K8s-based DBaaS platforms.

2. **Performance Overhead:** Containerization and virtualization can introduce performance overhead, particularly for DBaaS services with high I/O demands. Optimizing storage and network performance is critical. Solutions include leveraging high-performance CNIs like Cilium and using local PVs with NVMe storage in cloud or IDC environments to ensure low latency and high throughput.

3. **Data Reliability and High Availability**: Ensuring data reliability and high availability on Kubernetes is a significant challenge for stateful applications like databases. Kubernetes lacks native support for advanced database-specific failover mechanisms, consistency guarantees, and synchronous replication. Custom tooling or operators are often required to handle scenarios like automatic failover, data replication, and disaster recovery to meet enterprise-grade SLAs. Additionally, chaos testing tools are essential to validate these mechanisms under failure scenarios, ensuring the system can handle disruptions and maintain reliability.

4. **Security and Isolation**: Running databases on shared Kubernetes clusters requires robust security and isolation mechanisms. Protecting sensitive data, ensuring multi-tenancy isolation, and managing access controls at both the Kubernetes and database levels add layers of complexity. Additionally, monitoring for image vulnerabilities and ensuring timely updates are crucial to prevent potential exploits. Solutions like network policies, encryption, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and automated vulnerability scanning for container images must be carefully implemented and continuously maintained.
